SECTION-II
DIRECTION for questions 22 to 25: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given at
the end.
Passage- 1
Before the internet, one of the most rapid changes to the global economy and trade was wrought by something
so blatantly useful that it is hard to imagine a struggle to get it adopted: die shipping container. In the early
1960s, before the standard container became ubiquitous, freight costs were 10 per cent of the value of US
imports, about the same barrier to trade as the average official government import tariff. Yet in a journey that
went halfway round the world, half of those costs could be incurred in two ten-mile movements through the
ports at either end. The predominant 'break-bulk' method, where each shipment was individually split up into
loads that could be handled by a team of dockers, was vastly complex and labour-intensive. Ships could take
weeks or months to load, as a huge variety of cargoes of different weights, shapes and sizes had to be stacked
together by hand. Indeed, one of the most unreliable aspects of such a labour-intensive process was the labour.
Ports, like mines, were frequently seething pits of industrial unrest. Irregular work on one side combined with
what was often a tight-knit, well-organized labour community on the other.
In 1956, loading break-bulk cargo cost $5.83 per ton. The entrepreneurial genius who saw the possibilities for
standardized container shipping, Malcolm McLean, floated his first containerized ship in that year and
claimed to be able to shift cargo for 15.8 cents a ton. Boxes of the same size that could be loaded by crane and
neatly stacked were much faster to load. Moreover, carrying cargo in a standard container would allow it to be
shifted between truck, train and ship without having to be repacked each time.
But between McLean's container and the standardization of the global market were an array of formidable
obstacles. They began at home in the US with the official Interstate Commerce Commission, which could
prevent price competition by setting rates for freight haulage by route and commodity, and the powerful
International Longshoremen's Association (TLA) labour union. More broadly, the biggest hurdle was
achieving what economists call 'network effects': the benefit of a standard technology rises exponentially as
more people use it To dominate world trade, containers had to be easily interchangeable between different
shipping lines, ports, trucks and railcars. And to maximize efficiency, they all needed to be the same size. The
adoption of a network technology often involves overcoming the resistance of those who are heavily invested
in the old system. And while the efficiency gains are clear to see, there are very obvious losers as well as
winners. For containerization, perhaps the most spectacular example was the demise of New York City as a
port.
In the early 1950s, New York handled a third of US seaborne trade in manufactured goods. But it was
woefully inefficient, even with existing break-bulk technology: 283 piers, 98 of which were able to handle
ocean-going ships, jutted out into the river from Brooklyn and Manhattan. Trucks bound for the docks had to
fight through the crowded, narrow streets of Manhattan, wait for an hour or two before even entering a pier,
and then undergo a laborious two-stage process in which the goods were first unloaded into a transit shed and
then loaded onto a ship. 'Public loader" work gangs held exclusive rights to load and unload on a particular
pier, a power in effect granted by the OLA, which enforced its monopoly with sabotage and violence against
competitors. The ILA fought ferociously against containerization, correctly foreseeing that it would destroy
their privileged position as bandits controlling the mountain pass. On this occasion, bypassing them simply
involved going across the river. A container port was built in New Jersey, where a 1500-foot wharf allowed
ships to dock parallel to shore and containers to be lifted on and off by crane. Between 1963-4 and 1975-6, die
number of days worked by longshoremen m Manhattan went from 1.4 million to 127,041.
Containers rapidly captured die transatlantic market, and then the growing trade with Asia. The effect of
containerization is hard to see immediately in freight rates, since the oil price hikes of the 1970s kept them
high, but the speed with which shippers adopted containerization made it dear it brought big benefits of
efficiency and cost The extraordinary growth of die Asian tiger economies of Singapore, Taiwan, Korea and

Hong Kong, which based their development strategy on exports, was greatly helped by the container trade that
quickly built up between the US and east Asia. Ocean-borne exports from South Korea were 2.9 million tons
in 1969 and 6 million in 1973, and its exports to the US tripled.
But the new technology did not get adopted all on its own. It needed a couple of pushes from government -
both, as it happens, largely to do with the military. As far as the ships were concerned, the same link between
the merchant and military navy that had inspired the Navigation Acts in seventeenth-century England endured
into twentieth-century America. The government's first helping hand was to give a spur to the system by
adopting it to transport military cargo. The US armed forces, seeing the efficiency of the system, started
contracting McLean's company Pan-Atlantic, later renamed Sea-land, to carry equipment to the quarter of a
million American soldiers stationed in Western Europe. One of the few benefits of America's misadventure in
Vietnam was a rapid expansion of containerization. Because war involves massive movements of men and
material, it is often armies that pioneer new techniques m supply chains.
The government's other role was in banging heads together sufficiently to get all companies to accept the
same size container. Standard sizes were essential to deliver the economies of scale that came from
interchangeability - which, as far as the military was concerned, was vital if the ships had to be
commandeered in case war broke out This was a significant problem to overcome, not least because all the
companies that had started using the container had settled on different sizes. Pan-Atlantic used 35-foot
containers, because that was the maximum size allowed on the highways in its home base in New Jersey.
Another of the big shipping companies, Matson Navigation, used a 24-foot container since its biggest trade
was in canned pineapple from Hawaii, and a container bigger than that would have been too heavy for a crane
to lift. Grace Line, which largely traded with Latin America, used a 17-foot container that was easier to truck
around winding mountain roads.
Establishing a US standard and then getting it adopted internationally took more than a decade. Indeed, not
only did the US Maritime Administration have to mediate in these rivalries but also to fight its own turf battles
with the American Standards Association, an agency set up by the private sector. The matter was settled by
using the power of federal money: the Federal Maritime Board (FMB), which handed out public subsidies for
shipbuilding, decreed that only the 8 x 8-foot containers in lengths of 10,20,30 or 40 feet would be eligible for
handouts.
22. Identify the correct statement:
1. The freight costs accounted for around 10 per cent of the value of imports in general during early
1960s, given the labour-intensive 'break-bulk' cargo handling.
2. As a result of growing adoption of containerized trade during 1969-73, while the ocean-borne
exports from South Korea in general more than doubled, the same to the US tripled.
3. The outbreak of the Vietnam war functioned as a major positive force towards rapid expansion of
containerization, as American imports from the country increased heavily.
4. In the early days of container trade development, a major shipping firm Matson Navigation used a
24-foot container since a bigger container was not suitable for its trucks.
23. Identify the false statement:
1. In the pre-containerization days, trucks bound for the New York docks had to pass through the
narrow streets, wait for an hour or two before even entering a pier, and then undergo a laborious
three-stage process for loading onto a ship.
2. Once satisfied with the effectiveness of containerized trade, the US military engaged the company
of Malcolm McLean to transport equipments for their soldiers stationed in Western Europe.
3. Cargo loading during 1960s usually took a long period, as it involved manual handling of huge
variety of cargoes of different weights, shapes and sizes.
4. The issue of standardization of the containers created led to a debate between the US government
and American Standards Association, but the question was finally sorted through public subsidy
programme by Federal Maritime Board.

DIRECTION for questions 26 to 29: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given at
the end.
Passage 2
I have tried to introduce into the discussion a number of attributes of consumer behaviour and motivations,
which I believe are important inputs into devising a strategy for commercially viable financial inclusion.
These related broadly to the (i) the sources of livelihood of the potential consumer segment for financial
inclusion (ii) how they spend their money, particularly on non-regular items (iii) their choices and motivations
with respect to saving and (iv) their motivations for borrowing and their ability to access institutional sources
of finance for their basic requirements. In discussing each of these sets of issues, I spent some time drawing
implications for business strategies by financial service providers. In this section, 1 wilt briefly highlight, at
the risk of some repetition, what I consider to be the key messages of the lecture.
The first message emerges from the preliminary discussion on the current scenario on financial inclusion, both
at the aggregate level and across income categories. The data suggest that even savings accounts, the most
basic financial service, have low penetration amongst the lowest income households. I want to emphasize that
we are not talking about Below Poverty Line households only; Rs. 50,000 per year in 2007, while perhaps not
quite middle class, was certainly quite far above the official poverty line. The same concerns about lack of
penetration amongst the lowest income group for loans also arise. To reiterate the question that arises from
these data patterns: is this because people can't access banks or other service providers or because they don't
see value in doing so? This question needs to be addressed if an effective inclusion strategy is to be
developed.
The second message is that the process of financial inclusion is going to be incomplete and inadequate if it is
measured only in terms of new accounts being opened and operated. From the employment and earning
patterns, there emerged a sense that better access to various kinds of financial services would help to increase
the livelihood potential of a number of occupational categories, which in turn would help reduce the income
differentials between these and more regular, salaried jobs. The fact that a huge proportion of the Indian
workforce is either self-employed and in the casual labour segment suggests the need for products that will
make access to credit easier to the former, while offering opportunities for risk mitigation and consumption
smoothing to the latter.
The third message emerges from the analysis of expenditure patterns is the significance of infrequent, but
quantitatively significant expenditures like ceremonies and medical costs. Essentially, dealing with these
kinds of expenditures requires either low-cost insurance options, supported by a correspondingly low-cost
health care system or a low level systematic investment plan, which allows even poor households to create

IIFT Paper 2011 8

enough of a buffer to deal with these demands as and when they arise. As has already been pointed out, it is
not as though such products are not being offered by domestic financial service providers. It is really a matter
of extending them to make them accessible to a very large number of lower income households, with a low
and possibly uncertain ability to maintain regular contributions.
The fourth message comes strongly from the motivations to both save and borrow, which, as one might
reasonably expect, significantly overlap with each other. It is striking that the need to deal with emergencies,
both financial and medical, plays such an important role in both sets of motivations. The latter is, as has been
said, amenable to a low-coat mass insurance scheme, with the attendant service provision. However, the
former, which is a theme that recurs through the entire discussion on consumer characteristics, certainly
suggests that the need for some kind of income and consumption smoothing product is a significant one in an
effective financial inclusion agenda. This, of course, raises broader questions about the role of social safety
nets, which offer at least some minimum income security and consumption smoothing. How extensive these
mechanisms should be, how much security they should offer and for how long and how they should be
financed are fundamental policy questions that go beyond the realm of the financial sector. However, to the
extent that risk mitigation is a significant financial need, it must receive die attention of any meaningful
financial inclusion strategy, in a way which provides practical answers to all these three questions.
The fifth and final message is actually the point I began the lecture with. It is the critical importance of the
principle of commercial viability. Every aspect of a financial inclusion strategy - whether it is the design of
products and services or the delivery mechanism -needs to be viewed in terms of the business opportunity that
it offers and not as a deliverable that has been imposed on the service provider. However, it is also important
to emphasize that commercial viability need not necessarily be viewed in terms of immediate cost and
profitability calculations. Like in many other products, financial services also offer the prospect of a life-cycle
model of marketing. Establishing a relationship with first-time consumers of financial products and services
offers the opportunity to leverage this relationship into a wider set of financial transactions as at least some of
these consumers move steadily up the income ladder. In fact, in a high growth scenario, a high proportion of
such households are likely to move quite quickly from very basic financial services to more and more
sophisticated ones. In other words, the commercial viability and profitability of a financial inclusion strategy
need not be viewed only from the perspective of immediacy. There is a viable investment dimension to it as
well.
26. Which of the following statements is incorrect ?
1. In order to succeed, financial inclusion has to be commercially viable.
2. Savings account is one of the basic vehicles for financial inclusion.
3. Savings accounts have low penetration amongst "Below Poverty Line" households only.
4. There is lack of penetration for loans amongst the lowest income group.
27. Which of the following statements is correct?
1. Financial inclusion is exclusively measured in terms of new accounts being opened and operated.
2. There is a felt need for better access to credit products for the self-employed.
3. It is felt that financial inclusion could be profitable from day one if a commercially viable strategy
is devised.
4. Financial Institutions must deliver social service through financial inclusion.
28. Identify the correct statement from the following:
1. Casual labour segment may not require risk mitigation products like insurance as their expenditures
on consumption are high relative to their incomes.
2. Income of upto Rs. 60,000 per year is the benchmark for official Poverty Line.
3. Financial sector should also look into their role of broadening social safety nets.
4. Risk mitigation of casual labour must receive attention in any meaningful financial inclusion
strategy.

DIRECTION for questions 30 to 33: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given
at the end.
Passage 3
When Ratan Tata moved the Supreme Court, claiming his right to privacy had been violated, he called Harish
Salve. The choice was not surprising. The former solicitor general had been topping the legal charts ever since
he scripted a surprising win for Mukesh Ambani against his brother Anil. That dispute set the gold standard
for legal tees. On Mukesh's side were Salve, Rohinton Nariman, and Abhishek Manu Singhvi. The younger
brother had an equally formidable line-up led by Ram Jethmalani and Mukul Rohatgi.
The dispute dated back three-and-a-half years to when Anil filed a case against his brother for reneging on an
agreement to supply 28 million cubic metres of gas per day from its Krishna-Godavari basin fields at a rate of
$ 2.34 for 17 years. The average legal fee was Rs. 25 lakh for a full day's appearance, not to mention the
overnight stays at Mumbai's five-star suites, business class travel, and on occasion, use of the private jet. Little
wonder though that Salve agreed to take on Tata's case pro bono. He could afford philanthropy with one of
India's wealthiest tycoons.
The lawyers' fees alone, at a conservative estimate, must have cost the Ambanis at least Rs. 15 crore each.
Both the brothers had booked their legal teams in the same hotel, first the Oberoi and, after the 26/11 Mumbai
attacks, the Trident. It's not the essentials as much as the frills that raise eyebrows. The veteran Jethmalani is
surprisingly the most modest in his fees since he does not charge rates according to the strength of the client's
purse. But as the crises have multiplied, lawyers' fees have exploded.
The 50 court hearings in the Haldia Petrochemicals vs. the West Bengal Government cost the former a total of
Rs. 25 crore in lawyer fees and the 20 hearings in the Bombay Mill Case, which dragged on for three years,
cost the mill owners almost Rs. 10 crore. Large corporate firms, which engage star counsels on behalf of the
client, also need to know their quirks. For instance, Salve will only accept the first brief. He will never be the
second counsel in a case. Some lawyers prefer to be paid partly in cash but the best are content with cheques.
Some expect the client not to blink while picking up a dinner tab of Rs. 1.75 lakh at a Chennai five star. A
lawyer is known to carry his home linen and curtains with him while traveling on work. A firm may even have
to pick up a hot Vertu phone of the moment or a Jaeger-LeCoutre watch of the hour to keep a lawyer in good
humour.
Some are even paid to not appear at all for the other side - Aryama Sundaram was retained by Anil Ambani in
the gas feud but he did not fight the case. Or take Raytheon when it was fighting the Jindals. Raytheon had
paid seven top lawyers a retainer fee of Rs. 2.5 lakh each just to ensure that the Jindals would not be able to
make a proper case on a taxation issue. They miscalculated when a star lawyer fought the case at the last
minute. "I don't take negative retainers", shrugs Rohatgi, former additional solicitor general. "A lawyer's job is
to appear for any client that comes to him. It's not for the lawyers to judge if a client is good or bad but the
court". Indeed. He is, after all, the lawyer who argued so famously in court that B. Ramalinga Raju did not
fudge any account in the Satyam Case. All he did was "window dressing".

Some high profile cases have continued for years, providing a steady source of income, from the Scindia
succession battle which dates to 1989, to the JetLite Sahara battle now in taxation arbitration to the BCCI
which is currently in litigation with Lalit Modi, Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab.
Think of the large law firms as the big Hollywood studios and the senior counsel as the superstar. There are a
few familiar faces to be found in most of the big ticket cases, whether it is the Ambani gas case, Vodafone
taxation or Bombay Mills case. Explains Salve, 'There is a reason why we have more than one senior advocate
on a case. When you're arguing, he's reading the court. He picks up a point or a vibe that you may have
missed." Says Rajan Karanjawala, whose firm has prepared the briefs for cases ranging from the Tata's recent
Tight to privacy case to Karisma Kapoor's divorce, "The four jewels in the crown today are Salve, Rohatgi,
Rohinton Nariman and Singhvi. They have replaced the old guard of Fali Nariman, Soli Sorabjee, Ashok
Desai and K.K. Venugopal." He adds, 'The one person who defies the generational gap is Jethmalani who was
India's leading criminal lawyer in the 1960s and is so today."
The demand for superstar lawyers has far outstripped the supply. So a one-man show by, say, Rohatgi can run
up billings of Rs. 40 crore, the same as a mid-sized corporate law firm like Titus and Co that employs 28
juniors. The big law firms such as AZB or Amarchand & Mangaldas or Luthra & Luthra have to do all the
groundwork for the counsel, from humouring the clerk to ensure the A-lister turns up on the hearing day to
sourcing appropriate foreign judgments in emerging areas such as environmental and patent laws. "We are
partners in this. There are so few lawyers and so many matters," points out Diljeet Titus.
As the trust between individuals has broken down, governments have questioned corporates and corporates
are questioning each other, and an array of new issues has come up. The courts have become stronger. "The
lawyer," says Sundaram, with the flourish mat has seen him pick up many Dhurandhares and Senakas at
pricey art auctions, "has emerged as the modern day purohit." Each purohit is head priest of a particular style.
Says Karanjawala, "Harish is the closest example in today's bar to Fali Nariman; Rohinton has the best law
library in his brain; Mukul is easily India's busiest lawyer while Manu Singhvi is the greatest multi-tasker."
Salve has managed a fine balancing act where he has represented Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati,
Parkash Singh Badal and Amarinder Singh, Lalit Modi and Subhash Chandra and even the Ambani brothers,
of course in different cases. Jethmalani is the man to call for anyone in trouble. In judicial circles he is known
as the first resort for the last resort. Even Jethmalani's junior Satish Maneshinde, who came to Mumbai in
1993 as a penniless law graduate from Karnataka, shot to fame (and wealth) after he got bail for Sanjay Dutt
in 1996. Now he owns a plush office in Worli and has become a one-stop shop for celebrities in trouble.

DIRECTION for questions 34 to 36: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given at
the end.
Passage 4
The second issue I want to address is one that comes up frequently - that Indian banks should aim to become
global Most people who put forward this view have not thought through the costs and benefits analytically;
they only see this as an aspiration consistent with India's growing international profile. In its 1998 report, the
Narasimham (II) Committee envisaged a three tier structure for the Indian banking sector: 3 or 4 large banks
having an international presence on the top, 8-10 mid-sized banks, with a network of branches throughout the
country and engaged in universal banking, in the middle, and local banks and regional rural banks operating in
smaller regions forming the bottom layer. However, the Indian banking system has not consolidated in the
manner envisioned by the Narasimham Committee. The current structure is that India has 81 scheduled
commercial banks of which 26 are public sector banks. 21 are private sector banks and 34 are foreign banks.
Even a quick review would reveal that there is no segmentation in the banking structure along the lines of
Narasimham II.
A natural sequel to this issue of the envisaged structure of the Indian banking system is the Reserve Bank's
position on bank consolidation. Our view on bank consolidation is that the process should be market-driven,
based on profitability considerations and brought about through a process of mergers & amalgamations
(M&As). The initiative for this has to come from the boards of the banks concerned which have to make a
decision based on a judgment of the synergies involved in the business models and the compatibility of the
business cultures. The Reserve Bank's role in the reorganisation of the banking system will normally be only
that of a facilitator.
It should-be noted though that bank consolidation through mergers is not always a totally benign option. On
the positive side ate a higher exposure threshold, international acceptance and recognition, improved risk
management and improvement in financials due to economies of scale and scope. This can be achieved both
through organic and inorganic growth. On the negative side, experience shows that consolidation would rail if
there are no synergies in the business models and there is no compatibility in the business cultures and
technology platforms of the merging banks.
Having given that broad brush position on bank consolidation, let me address two specific questions: (i) can
Indian banks aspire to global size?; and CO should Indian banks aspire to global size?
On the first question, as per the current global league tables based on the size of assets, our largest bank, the
State Bank of India (SBI), together with its subsidiaries, comes in at No.74 followed by ICICI Bank at No.
145 and Bank of Baroda at 188. It is, therefore, unlikely that any of our banks will jump into the top ten of the
global league even after reasonable consolidation.

Then comes the next question of whether Indian banks should become global. Opinion on this is divided.
Those who argue that, we must go global contend that the issue is not so much the size of our banks in global
rankings but of Indian banks having a strong enough global presence. The main argument is that the
increasing global size and influence of Indian corporates warrant a corresponding increase in the global
footprint of Indian banks. The opposing view is that Indian banks should look inwards rather than outwards,
focus their efforts on financial deepening at home rather than aspiring to global size.
It is possible to fake a middle path and argue that looking outwards towards increased global presence and
looking inwards towards deeper financial penetration are not mutually exclusive; it should be possible to aim
for both. With the onset of the global financial crisis, there has definitely been « pause to the rapid expansion
overseas of our banks. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the risks involved, it will be opportune for some of our
larger banks to be looking out for opportunities for consolidation both organically and inorganically. They
should look out more actively in regions which hold out a promise of attractive acquisitions.
The surmise, therefore, is that Indian banks should increase their global footprint opportunistically even if
they do not get to the top of the league table.
34. Identify the correct statement from the following:
1. Large banks having an international presence should not be engaged in universal banking.
2. Some people expect all banks to become global in coming years, in line with globalization.
3. Indian banking system has not consolidated as was foreseen by the Narasimham Committee.
4. Reserve Bank of India envisages the role of a facilitator for itself in the direction of bank
consolidation.
35. Identify the correct statement from the following:
1. Indian banks should not go for global inorganic expansion as there is no compatibility in business
cultures.
2. Indian banks do not aspire to be global.
3. Indian banks cannot be global even after reasonable consolidation.
4. After die onset of the global financial crisis, some, regions hold out a promise of attractive
acquisitions for banks.
36. Identify the wrong statement from the following:
1. Bank consolidation through mergers increases the merged entity's ability to take higher exposures.
2. There is still scope for Indian banks to expand internally.
3. None of the Indian banks presently are global.
4. Global financial crisis has increased the risks of overseas expansion.

61. Investment of Sanjay = 35000 × 12 = 420000/-
Investment of Mritunjoy = 130000 × 6 = 7800000/-
Investment of Pranjoy= 75000 × 8 = 600000/-
Ratio = 420,000: 780,000; 600000/-= 7 : 13 : 10.
After Deducting 10% the remaining profit
= 450000 × 0.9 = 405000
Share of Pranjoy =

SECTION-IV
DIRECTION for the questions 85 to 100: Read the following passages carefully and answer the questions at
the end of each passage
Passage 1
Asked what a business is, the typical businessman is likely to answer, "An organisation to make a profit." The
typical economist is likely to give the same answer. This answer is not only false, it is irrelevant.
The prevailing economic theory of the mission of business enterprise and behaviour, the maximization of
profit - which is simply a complicated way of phrasing the old saw of buying cheap and selling dear - may
adequately explain how Richard Sears operated. But it cannot explain how Sears, Roebuck or any other
business enterprise operates, or how it should operate. The concept of profit maximization is, in fact,
meaningless. The danger in the concept of profit maximization is that it makes profitability appear a myth.
Profit and profitability are, however, crucial - for society even more than for the individual business. Yet
profitability is not the purpose of, but a limiting factor on business enterprise and business activity. Profit is
not the explanation, cause, or rationale of business behaviour and business decisions, but rather the test of
their validity. If archangels instead of businessmen sat in directors' chairs, they would still have to be
concerned with profitability, despite their total lack of personal interest in making profits.
The root of the confusion is the mistaken belief that the motive of a person - the so called profit motive of the
businessman - is an explanation of his behaviour or his guide to right action. Whether there is such a thing as a
profit motive at all is highly doubtful. The idea was invented by the classical economists to explain the
economic reality that their theory of static equilibrium could not explain. There has never been any evidence
for the existence of the profit motive, and we have long since found the true explanation of the phenomena of
economic change and growth which the profit motive was first put forth to explain.
It is irrelevant for an understanding of business behaviour, profit, and profitability, whether there is a profit
motive or not. That Jim Smith is in business to make a profit concerns only him and the Recording Angel. It
does not tell us what Jim Smith does and how he performs. We do not learn anything about the work of a
prospector hunting for uranium in the Nevada desert by being told that he is trying to make his fortune. We do
not learn anything about the work of a heart specialist by being told that he is trying to make a livelihood, or
even that he is trying to benefit humanity. The profit motive and its offspring maximisation of profits are just
as irrelevant to the function of a business, the purpose of a business, and the job of managing a business.
In fact, the concept is worse than irrelevant: it does harm. It is a major cause of the misunderstanding of the
nature of profit in our society and of the deep -seated hostility to profit, which are among the most dangerous
diseases of an industrial society. It is largely responsible for the worst mistakes of public policy - in this
country as well as in Western Europe - which are squarely based on the failure to understand the nature,
function, and purpose of business enterprise. And it is in large part responsible for the prevailing belief that
there is an inherent contradiction between profit and a company's ability to make a social contribution.
Actually, a company can make a social contribution only if it is highly profitable.
To know what a business is, we have to start with its purpose. Its purpose must lie outside of the business
itself. In fact, it must lie in society since business enterprise is an organ of society. There is only one valid
definition of business purpose: to create a customer.
Markets are not created by God, nature, or economic forces but by businesspeople. The want a business
satisfies may have been felt by the customer before he or she was offered the means of satisfying it. Like food
in a famine, it may have dominated the customer's life and filled all his waking moments, but it remained a
potential want until the action of business people converted it into effective demand. Only then is there a
customer and a market. The want may have been unfelt by the potential customer; no one knew that he wanted
16 IIFT Paper 2012

www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c o m
a Xerox machine or a computer until these became available. There may have been no want at all until
business action created it - by innovation, by credit, by advertising, or by salesmanship. In every case, it is
business action that creates the customer.
85. The author of this passage is of the opinion that profits and profitability are:
1. The purpose of setting up a business
2. The sole goal and responsibility of a businessman
3. The test of validity of business existence
4. The guiding factor for a businessman's actions and decisions
86. This passage highlights that the theory of profit maximisation and profit motive
1. Is largely responsible for the worst mistakes in public policy
2. Is a synchronised goal with a company's ability to make a social contribution
3. Is the main purpose and job of managing a business
4. Was an idea not invented by classical economists
87. As stated in this passage, the purpose of a business is to
1. Make profits 2. Increase wants 3. Create customers 4. Manage Demand
88. According to the author of this passage, what comes first?
1. Want 2. Market 3. Demand 4. Customer
Passage 2
The first thing I learned at school was that some people are idiots; the second thing I learned was that some
are even worse. I was still too young to grasp that people of breeding were meant to affect innocence of this
fundamental distinction, and that the same courtesy applied to any disparity that might rise out of religious,
racial, sexual class, financial and (latterly) cultural difference. So in my innocence I would raise my hand
every time the teacher asked a question, just to make it clear I knew the answer.
After some months of this, the teacher and my classmates must have been vaguely aware I was a good student,
but still I felt the compulsion to raise my hand. By now the teacher seldom called on me, preferring to give
other children a chance to speak, too. Still my hand shot up without my even willing it, whether or not I knew
the answer. If I was putting on airs, Jike someone who even in ordinary clothes, adds a gaudy piece of
jewellery, it's also true that I admired my teacher and was desperate to cooperate.
Another thing I was happy to discover at school was the teacher's 'authority'. At home, in the crowded and
disordered Pamuk Apartments, things were never so clear; at our crowded table, everyone talked at the same
time. Our domestic routines, our love for one another, our conversations, meals and radio hours; these were
never debated - they just happened. My father held little obvious authority at home, and he was often absent.
He never scolded my brother or me, never even raised his eyebrows in disapproval. In later years, he would
introduce us to his friends as 'my two younger brothers', and we felt he had earned the right to say so. My
mother was the only authority I recognised at home. But she was hardly a distant or alien tyrant: her power
came from my desire to be loved by her. And so I was fascinated by the power my teacher wielded over her
twenty-five pupils.
Perhaps I identified my teacher with my mother, for I had an insatiable desire for her approval. 'Join your
arms together like this and sit down quietly,' she would say, and I would press my arms against my chest and
sit patiently all through the lesson. But gradually the novelty wore off; soon it was no longer exciting to have
www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c om 17
Bulls Eye IIFT Paper 2012
every answer or solve an arithmetic problem ahead of everyone else or earn the highest mark; time began to
flow with painful slowness, or stop flowing altogether.
Turning away from the fat, half-witted girl who was writing on the blackboard, who gave everyone - teachers,
school caretakers and her classmates - the same vapid, trusting smile, my eyes would float to the window, to
the upper branches of the chestnut tree that I could just see rising up between the apartment buildings. A crow
would land on a branch. Because I was viewing it from below, I could see the little cloud floating behind it -
as it moved, it kept changing shape: first a fox's nose, then a head, then a dog. I didn't want it to stop looking
like a dog, but as it continued its journey it changed into one of the four-legged silver sugar bowls from my
grandmother's always-locked display case, and I'd long to be at home. Once I'd conjured up the reassuring
silence of the shadows of home, my father would step out from them, as if from a dream, and off we'd go on a
family outing to the Bosphorus. Just then, a window in the apartment building opposite would open, a maid
would shake her duster and gaze absentmindedly at the street that I could not see from where I was sitting.
What was going down there? I'd wonder. I'd hear a horse cart rolling over the cobblestones, and a rasping
voice would cry out 'Eskiciiiiiii! The maid would watch the junk dealer make his way down the street before
pulling her head back inside and shutting the window behind her, but then, right next to that window, moving
as fast as the first cloud but going in the opposite direction, I'd see a second cloud. But now my attention was
called back to the classroom, and seeing all the other raised hands, I would eagerly raise my hand too: long
before I worked out from my classmates' responses what the teacher had asked us, I was foggily confident I
had the answer.
It was exciting, though sometimes painful, to get to know my classmates as individuals, and to find out how
different they were from me. There was that sad boy who, whenever he was asked to read out loud in Turkish
class, would skip every other line; the poor boy's mistake was as involuntary as the laughter it would elicit
from the class. In first grade, there was a girl who kept her red hair in a ponytail, who sat next to me for a
time. Although her bag was a slovenly jumble of half-eaten apples, simits, sesame seeds, pencils and hair
bands, it always smelled of dried lavender around her, and that attracted me; I was also drawn to her gift for
speaking so openly about the little taboos of daily life, and if I didn't see her at the weekend, I missed her,
though there was another girl so tiny and delicate that I was utterly entranced by her as well. Why did that boy
keep on telling lies even knowing no one was going to believe him? How could that girl be so indiscreet about
the goings-on in her house? And could this other girl be shedding real tears as she read that poem about
Ataturk?
Just as I was in the habit of looking at the fronts of cars and seeing noses, so too did I like to scrutinise my
classmates, looking for the creatures they resembled. The boy with the pointed nose was a fox and the big one
next to him was, as everyone said, a bear, and the one with the thick hair was a hedgehog... I remember a
Jewish girl called Mari telling us all about Passover - there were days when no one in her grandmother's house
was allowed to touch the light switches. Another girl reported that one evening, when she was in her room,
she turned around so fast she glimpsed the shadow of an angel - a fearsome story that stayed with me. There
was a girl with very long legs who wore very long socks and always looked as if she was about to cry; her
father was a government minister and when he died in a plane crash from which Prime Minister Menederes
emerged without a scratch, I was sure she'd been crying because she had known in advance what was going to
happen. Lots of children had problems with their teeth; a few wore braces. On the top floor of the building
that housed the lycee dormitory and the sports hall, just next to the infirmary, there was rumoured to be a
dentist, and when teachers got angry they would often threaten to send naughty children there. For lesser
infractions pupils were made to stand in the corner between the blackboard and the door with their backs to
the class, sometimes one leg, but because we were all so curious to see how long someone could stand on one
leg, the lessons suffered, so this particular punishment was rare.

Passage 3
Not many people saw it coming. It had seemed that the time for Kaun Banega Crorepati had come and gone.
This column argued as much a few years ago, when Shah Rukh Khan took over the reigns of the show. He did
well enough, but it still seemed that the time for the genteel-game of knowledge had passed. There was too
much blood in reality television, and KBC simply did not have enough platelets for it. It had no backbiting
intrigue, it lacked a cast of almost-losers and missed the low-life loquaciousness of other reality- shows, and
nothing ever needed to be beeped out on it, a sure touch that it was out of touch with the times.
And yet, not only is KBC back, but it is back in a very real sense not just as a TV show that gets good ratings,
but as an idea that connects with something deep and real in our lives. What makes this particularly interesting
is that not very much has changed in the show. Its focus has shifted to smaller towns and an 'aadmi' more
'aam', and the prize money has gone up over the years, but these are minor adjustments, not major departures.
The format is pretty much the same and the return of Amitabh Bachchan restores to the show both the gravitas
and the empathy that has been its hallmark.
Perhaps KBC works because it reconciles many competing ideas for us. For a show that bestows undreamt of
wealth on people who win, and does so with reasonable regularity, KBC manages somehow to rise above the
money it throws around. By locating money squarely in the context of small dreams, family and community,
KBC shows us a face of money that is ennobling. The money of KBC is treated not as a jackpot but as a
'vardaan', a gift from divinity that comes for one's persistent effort, a prize for the penance called ordinary life.
The images that surround the winners are not big cars and fancy brands, but houses made 'pukka' and IAS
dreams pursued. The winners have been remarkable ambassadors for the show, focusing not what the money
buys them but what it enables them to work at in the future. Money speaks in the language of responsibility,
not indulgence and steeps a larger collective in its pleasing warmth.
The format of the show ensures that we see people as they are. rather than the usual sight of raw innocents
losing their transparent naivete in a haze of hair dye and exfoliation. On other reality shows, fame and money
•'are insistent in transforming those that they favour and what they tell us is that success must put distance
between destination and sources, between who we are and what we must become. On KBC, it is the innocence
that is spoken to and as an audience it is this quality we respond to. When a Sushil Kumar describes his life
and attributes his success to his wife, who in turn is quick to shyly shrug off the credit, we see, for once,
something that smacks of the real on a reality show.
As the reality show evolved, it found reality too boring and vapid. It was so much for fun to manufacture it by
making people act in unpleasant ways, and say unsavoury things to each other. Now, no reality show can
www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c om 19
Bulls Eye IIFT Paper 2012
really bring us reality; any act of representation and framing creates its own version of reality in many
different ways - by aestheticizing it. emotionalising moments, dramatising revelations, withholding
information selectively, or by imbuing some moments with significance, while ignoring others and even KBC
uses these techniques. The difference is that it uses these to drive us towards the central premise of the show
rather than see those as individual 'masala' elements. In a world where television is racked by anxiety about
itself, and where every new season is an exercise in renewed desperation, KBC stands apart by continuing to
tell a human story about dreams and their fulfilment and doing so without trying too hard.
There is no question that KBC rests on the persona of Amitabh Bachchan for he reconciles for us the ideas of
fame and humility, of achievement and empathy in the way he treats the participants. He has a special ability
to look into the ordinary and find something special and the humility to be awed by it. He is simultaneously
The Amitabh Bachchan, the wax God who we touch and squeal when we find out that it is real and a fellow
sympathiser and co-traveller on the journey called life. As a carrier of life-altering destiny, he underplays his
role to perfection, acknowledging the enormity of what winning means for the participant while revealing the
wisdom that knows that it is only money. Under his steerage money is no longer cold with acquisitive urgency
but warm with unfolding possibility.
KBC shows us, close-up and in slow motion, the act of a miracle colliding with a dream. In doing so, it tells
us that money can change things for the better, when it finds the right home. By applying good fortune to
good intention, it keeps the miracle alive, well after the moment of impact. As the winners no doubt find out,
one can never have enough money, and that relative scale makes everyone a relative pauper. In the final
analysis, Kaun Banega Crorepati reveals both the nobility and the eventual poverty of money, no matter if it
comes in eight figures.
93. According to the author's opinion a few years before writing this article, which of the following
appeared to be in store for KBC?
i. The show's time was over
ii. The show was too refined to compete with other reality shows
iii. Shah Rukh Khan as the show host would take it to new heights
iv. The show's viciousness was leading it to its end
1. i only 2. i and ii 3. ii and iii 4. I and iv
94. Unlike most reality shows, KBC has gained viewership on television by
1. Using glamorous participants on the show
2. Getting participants to say unpleasant things about the truth of life
3. Making major adjustments to its format time and again
4. Connecting with the depth and reality of lives of people
95. According to the author, KBC presents the prize money as
1. a means for indulgence 2. a jackpot
3. a reward for relentless work 4. a reason for changing the real person
96. In what context does the author of the phrase "a relative pauper"?
1. No one can ever have enough money
2. Money can change who we are
3. Money is cold and has masterialistic importance
4. Money can change things for better only if it finds the right home

Passage 4
Babur's head was throbbing with the persistent ache that dogged him during the monsoon. The warm rain had
been falling for three days now but the still, heavy air held no promise of relief. The rains would go on for
weeks, even months. Lying back against silken bolsters in his bedchamber in the Agra fort, he tried to imagine
the chill, thin rains of Ferghana blowing in over the jagged summit of Mount Beshtor and failed. The punkah
above his head hardly disturbed the air. It was hard even to remember what it was like not to feel hot. There
was little pleasure just now even in visiting his garden - the sodden flowers, soggy ground and overflowing
water channels only depressed him.
Babur got up and tried to concentrate on writing an entry in his diary but the words wouldn't come and he
pushed his jewel-studded inkwell impatiently aside. Maybe he would go to the women's apartments. He would
ask Maham to sing. Sometimes she accompanied herself on the round-bellied, slender-necked lute that had
once belonged to Esan Dawlat. Maham lacked her grandmother's gift but the lute still made a sweet sound in
her hands.
Or he might play a game of chess with Humayun. His son had a shrewd, subtle mind - but so, he prided
himself, did he and he could usually beat him. It amused him to see Humayun's startled look as he claimed
victory with the traditional cry shah mat - 'check-mate', 'the king is at a loss'. Later, they would discuss
Babur's plans to launch a campaign when the rains eased against the rulers of Bengal. In their steamy jungles
in the Ganges delta, they thought they could defy Moghul authority and deny Babur's overlordship.
'Send for my son Humayun and fetch my chessmen,' Babur ordered a servant. Trying to shake off his lethargy
he got up and went to a casement projecting over the riverbank to watch the swollen, muddy waters of the
Jumna rushing by. A farmer was leading his bony bullocks along the oozing bank.
Hearing footsteps Babur turned, expecting to see his son, but it was only the white-tunicked servant.
'Majesty, your son begs your forgiveness but he is unwell and cannot leave his chamber.'
What is the matter with him?'
'I do not know, Majesty.'
Humayun was never ill. Perhaps he, too, was suffering from the torpor that came with the monsoon, sapping
the energy and spirit of even the most vigorous.
'I will go to him.' Babur wrapped a yellow silk robe around himself and thrust his feet into pointed kidskin
slippers. Then he hurried from his apartments to Humayun's on the opposite side of a galleried courtyard,
where water was not shooting, as it should, in sparkling arcs from the lotus-shaped marble basins of the
fountains but pouring over the inundated rims.
Humayun was lying on his bed, arms thrown back, eyes closed, forehead beaded with sweat, shivering. When
he heard his father's voice he opened his eyes but they were bloodshot, the ** Babur could hear his heavy
wheezing breathing. Every scratchy intake or an seemed an effort which hurt him.
'When did this illness begin?'
'Early this morning, Father.'
'Why wasn't I told?' Babur looked angrily at his son's attendants. 'Send for my hakim immediately!' Then he
dipped his own silk handkerchief into some water and wiped Humayun's brow. The sweat returned at once - in
fact, it was almost running down his face and he seemed to be shivering even more violently now and his teeth
had begun to chatter.
'Majesty, the hakim is here.'
www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c om 21
Bulls Eye IIFT Paper 2012
Abdul-Malik went immediately to Humayun's bedside, laid a hand on his forehead, pulled back his eyelids
and felt his pulse. Then, with increasing concern, he pulled open Humayun's robe and, bending, turned his
neatly turbaned head to listen to Humayun's heart
'What is wrong with him?'
Abdul-Malik paused. 'It is hard to say, Majesty. I need to examine him further.'
'Whatever you require you only have to say...'
'I will send for my assistants. If I may be frank, it would be best if you were to leave the chamber, Majesty. I
will report to you when I have examined the prince thoroughly - but it looks serious, perhaps even grave. His
pulse and heartbeat are weak and rapid.' Without waiting for Babur's reply, Abdul-Malik turned back to his
patient. Babur hesitated and, after a glance at his son's waxen trembling face, left the room. As attendants
closed the doors behind him he found that he, too, was trembling.
A chill closed round his heart. So many times he had feared for Humayun. At Panipat he could have fallen
beneath the feet of one of Sultan Ibrahim's war elephants. At Khanua he might have been felled by the slash of
a Rajput sword. But he had never thought that Humayun - so healthy and strong - might succumb to sickness.
How could he face life without his beloved eldest son? Hindustan and all its riches would be worthless if
Humayun died. He would never have come to this sweltering, festering land with its endless hot rains and
whining, bloodsucking mosquitoes if he had known this would be the price.

1. the rulers of Bengal were defying Moghul authority

EXPLANATIONS
1. The letters appear in the following order as per the
rearrangement defined in the question.
EHRIRAHCCILA. In this the position of R from the left
is at number 3 and 5 and the two Cs are at position
number 8 & 9. Thus answer is option A.
2. In the given series, there are three parallel series.
1st - -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ; Here one number is added to the
previous term.
2nd - 0,2,6,12,20 ; Here numbers are added in the
sequence of 2, 4, 6, 8 and so on
3rd – 1, 9, 16, 25 ; Here the squares of the numbers form
the sequence.
Hence option C
3. From 1st and 2nd statement, onot – oak. Similarly from
2nd and 3rd statement, bly- leaf. Therefore from 3rd
statement, crin- maple and will be written as second
word. Hence option C will be the answer.
4. From the 1st statement Age of Gita > Age of Mita. From
2nd statement Age of Bhanu > Age of Gita. Therefore
Age of bhanu > Gita > Mita. So the only conclusion
follows is Mita is the youngest. Hence option D
5. From 1st statement Height of Priya > Tiya but < Siya i.e
S>P>T
From 2nd statement Height of Riya < Siya but > Priya
i.e. S>R>P
From 3rd statement Height of Riya > Diya and Diya <
Tiya i.e. R>D<T.
Combining all the statements we get S>R>P>T>D.
Hence option C
6. 1st statement is not a fact as no conclusion can be drawn
about the gender of birds.
2nd statement is also not a fact because the conclusion
can be drawn is some hens are Birds but not all.
3rd statement is also not a fact because we cannot
withdraw negative conclusion from the given statement
Hence answer is option D
Bird

7. As shown in the diagram, we can only conclude that
some story books (SB) have words (W) and pictures
(Pic.)
Hence option C is the answer
8. IQS : LNV . Here for the 1st and 3rd alphabet,
numerically 2 is added while for the 2nd alphabet,
numerically 2 is subtracted i.e. I j k L, Q p o N, S t u V.
So for JRM, it will be MOP. Hence option B
9. As per the directions, given in the question, N will never
work with K. Now as K is already there, so N cannot
work in the same. Option A, B, and D all have N
appearing in the same and hence cannot be the answer.
C option is the answer which does not contradict any of
the conditions. Hence option C
10. As N is already involved in the show that implies that K
should not be working in the same show. Option A, B
and C have K appearing in the show, which cannot
happen. Hence option D, will be the answer.
11. From 1st statement the moderator sits on seat no 3. From
4th statement, 2nd and 4th seat is occupied by writer and
attorney but not in the same order. Since the 7th
statement provides that Gaj is attorney and sits on seat
no 4, therefore seat no 2 is occupied by writer. Now
from 2nd statement , we follow that attorney (Gaj) cannot
seat next to explorer, therefore seat no 5 will be
occupied by Lalit (Pilot) ,( from 3rd statement) therefore
seat no 1 will be occupied by explorer . Since moderator
cannot sit next to jaya or lalit (from 6th statement),
therefore seat no 1 will be occupied by Jaya (explorer).
Now from 5th statement Hema sits between Kumar and
Jaya, so her seat no will be 2nd, therefore seat no 3 will
be occupied by Kumar.
So seat no 1- Jaya (explorer), seat no 2- Hema (writer),
seat no 3-Kumar (moderator), seat no 4- Gaj (attorney),
seat no 5-Lalit (pilot).
Q11- Option D
12. From 1st statement the moderator sits on seat no 3. From
4th statement, 2nd and 4th seat is occupied by writer and
attorney but not in the same order. Since the 7th
statement provides that Gaj is attorney and sits on seat
no 4, therefore seat no 2 is occupied by writer. Now
from 2nd statement , we follow that attorney (Gaj) cannot
seat next to explorer, therefore seat no 5 will be
occupied by Lalit (Pilot) ,( from 3rd statement) therefore
seat no 1 will be occupied by explorer . Since moderator
cannot sit next to jaya or lalit (from 6th statement),
therefore seat no 1 will be occupied by Jaya (explorer).
Now from 5th statement Hema sits between Kumar and
Jaya, so her seat no will be 2nd, therefore seat no 3 will
be occupied by Kumar.
So seat no 1- Jaya (explorer), seat no 2- Hema (writer),
seat no 3-Kumar (moderator), seat no 4- Gaj (attorney),
seat no 5-Lalit (pilot).
Q12- Option A
13. Here the rule is firstly the smallest no comes first , then
in next step, largest no is filtered and then again the
second smallest and then second largest and so on
S1- 64 432 326 187 87 118 219 348
S2- 64 432 87 326 187 118 219 348

S4- 64 432 87 348 118 326 187 219
Hence Option C
14. S1- 15 319 318 746 123 320 78 426
S2- 15 746 319 318 123 320 78 426
S3- 15 746 78 319 318 123 320 426
S4- 15 746 78 426 319 318 123 320
S5- 15 746 78 426 123 319 318 320
S6- 15 746 78 426 123 320 319 318
S7- 15 746 78 426 123 320 318 319
Hence option D
15. F ? S $ B * V
From the diagram we can see the direction of F with
respect to V is South. Hence option B
16.
From the diagram we can see that Ritvik is 10km far
from his house. Hence option C
17. Here for each alphabet, their corresponding number is
assigned i.e. H-8, B-2, P-16, C-3, F-6, R-18, E-5, T-20.
In each column we see the product of first two numbers
is equal to the third no. i.e. 8*2=16, 3*6=18 therefore
following the trend we find 5*4=20 and we know D-4.
Hence option C
18. Mon Tue Wed Thur
Original Schedule- Jai Farid Raj Kajal
After first swap- Raj Kajal Jai Farid
After 2nd swap- Raj Jai Kajal Farid
Hence option A
19. A) 5,7- EXPAND 2,9- REDUCE
B) 8,10- GOSSIP 1,3-DESSERT
C) 8,10- GOSSIP 1,5-EXPERT
D) No meaningful words
Only Option A gives the opposite meaning. Hence
option A
20.
As we can see in the diagram, after 50 minutes the
minute hand will point towards East. Hence option C
21. Total Import over the years = 2170
Total Export = 1975
So total export is smaller by 9%
2170
195 ?
22. The ascending order is 2007, 2005, 2009 and 2010. So
4th rank is year 2010.

0.0010101×106 = 1010.1 > 1000
41. Biscuits + Chips = 10 ? Total = 11 possibilities
When 10 chips, 0 biscuits ? P(3 chips) = 120/120
When 9 chips, 1 biscuit ? P = 9C3/10C3 = 84/120
When 8 chips, 2 biscuit ? P = 8C3/10C3 = 56/120
When 7 chips, 3 biscuit ? P = 7C3/7C3 = 35/120 and so
on...
P = 84/(120 + 84 + 56 + 35 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1) = 14/55
42. 7x-1 + 11x-1 = 170
For x =3, 73-1 + 113-1 = 49 + 121 = 170
It being an incremental function, thus for higher values
of x, LHS > 170 ? It has only one solution.
43. Let production in 2008 be x.
? Production in 2012 = x×1.18×1.18×0.88×1.18 =
1.446x
Therefore, approximately cement production is
increased by 45%.
44. Since log 3, log (3x – 2) and log(3x + 4) are in AP.
? 2log(3x – 2) = log(3x + 4) + log 3
? log(3x – 2)2 = log(3x + 4).3
? (3x – 2)2 = (3x + 4).3
Let 3x = y, ? (y – 2)2 = 3(y + 4)
? y2 – 4y + 4 = 3y + 12
? y2 – 7y – 8 = 0
? (y + 1) (y – 8) = 0
Solving, we get y = 8 and y = -1
? 3x = 8 and 3x = -1
Rejecting negative value, x = log38.
45. Required number of ways = 5C2 × 5C4 + 5C3 × 5C3 + 5C4
× 5C2
= 5×10 + 10×10 + 5×10 = 200
46. Favorable cases = Selecting 2 professors AND
distributing 5 papers.
Select 2 professors = 9C2 = 36
Distribute 5 papers: 25 - 2! = 30
Total = 36×30 = 1080
Sample space:
Select 1 professor = 9C1 = 9
Select 2 professor = 9C2 × (25 - 2!) = 1080
Select 3 professor = 9C3 × (3C1 × 5C1 × 4C2 + 3C1 × 5C2 ×
2!) = 84 × (90 + 60) = 12600
Select 4 professor = 9C4 × 4C1 × 5C2 × 3! = 126 × 240 =
30240
Select 5 professor = 9C5 × 5! = 126 × 120 = 15120
Total = 59049
Required Probability = 1080/59049= 120/6561=
40/2187
47. Solve the question using answer options. Surely, the
answer can be determined, so option D is eliminated.
From the remaining options, start with the middle option
i.e. 13500. If 13500 is the amount invested at 6% then
25000-13500 = 11500 is the amount invested at 8%.
Total interest earned for this arrangement is Rs.3580
(approx.). Thus, to reduce this value to the required
value i.e. Rs.3518, more amount should be invested at a
lower rate of interest. From here, we get the answer as
Rs.15000.
48. Probability (LPG will last for 60 days or more) = 0.8
? Probability (LPG will last for less than 60 days) = 1 -
0.8 = 0.2
Also, Probability (LPG will last for at most 90 days) =
0.6 ? Probability (LPG will last for more than 90 days)
= 1 - 0.6 = 0.4
Therefore, P(LPG lasts for =60 days and =90 days) = 1 –
0.2 – 0.4 = 0.4
49. Extra amount received by each department = (6×107 –
4.5×107)/200
= 15000000/200 = 7.5×104
50. Since area of the land portion = 20350,
Thus, area of circular field – area of tank = 20350
? pr2 - 130×110 = 20350
? pr2 = 20350 + 14300 = 34650
? r2 = 34650/p = 11025
? r = 105 m
51. Volume of the hemispherical bowl = 2pr3/3
Given that diameter of the cylindrical vessel is the same
as that of the hemispherical bowl. Thus, radius of vessel
= r and height = 2r/3.
www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c om 29
Bulls Eye IIFT Paper 2012
Therefore, volume of the cylindrical vessel = pr2h =
2pr3/3.
Thus, the volume transferred from bowl will fill 100%
of the cylindrical vessel.
52. n the larger triangle, tan 60° = 60/Base
? Base = 60/v3
Now in the other triangle, tan 30° = Height/(60/v3)
? Height = (60/v3)×(1/v3) = 60/3 = 20 m
Therefore, height of the other building
= Height of the bigger triangle –
Height of the smaller triangle
= 60 – 20 = 40 m
53. Relative speed of the two trains = 60 + 48 = 108 km/hr =
30 m/s
Therefore, time taken to cross another train, 15 s = (L +
0.5L)/30 ? L = 450/1.5 = 300 m
Similarly, time taken to cross the bridge, 51 = (300 +
LB)/(50/3) ? LB = (51×50/3) – 300 = 850 – 300 = 550
m is the length of the bridge.
54. Comparing efficiencies of Man and Woman, we get
12M × 10 = 20W × 12 ? 1M = 2W
Thus, 8M = 16W.
Therefore, initial persons working are equivalent to 20
women and these 20 women can complete 3/4th work in
9 days. Thus, 1/4th work (of 3 days) is now remaining.
When 10 more women will join, total women will be 30
and hence they can complete the remaining 1/4th work in
2 days.
55. Reduction in speed = Constant × vNumber of wagons
attached ? 45 – 30 = K × v9 ? K = 15/3 = 5
Now, when the speed is reduced to zero (because of
max. wagons), Then, 45 – 0 = 5 × vW ? vW = 45/5 = 9
? W = 81.
But with 81 wagons attached, the speed will be zero.
Therefore, the greatest no. of wagons with which the
train can just move is 80.
56. ATQ, Total charges = Variable charges + Fixed charges
? 400 × 20 = 20 × V + F ? 8000 = 20V + F
Also, 300 × 40 = 40 × V + F ? 12000 = 40V + F
Subtracting the 2 equations, we get 20V = 4000 ? V =
200
Putting the value back in one of the equation, F = 4000.
Thus, total expenses for 80 students = 80×200 + 4000 =
20000
Hence, average expense per students = 20000/80 =
Rs.250
57. Since Rohit got no return on unsold items, thus we can
assume that for these items there is no profit no loss.
Hence, his overall profit will be the profit earned on the
already sold items i.e. Rs. 385.
58.
Let X = 7 ? 7 ? 7 ? 7 ???
?x ? 7 ? 7 ? x
Squaring both sides, x2 = 7 ? 7 ? x
? x2 – 7 = 7 ? x
Again squaring, we get (x2 – 7)2 = 7 – x
Now, by putting the values from answer options, it can
be verified that option C i.e. 3 satisfies the above
equation.
59. (8263)153×(341)72
As cyclicity of 3 is of 4 steps. So when 153 are divided
by 4 than remainder is obtained is 1. So unit digit it of
(8263)153 is 3. Unit digit it of 1 is always 1. So unit digit
it of (8263)153×(341)72 is 3 × 1 = 3.
60. Since Z is the product of first 31 natural numbers, thus Z
= 31! & X = 31!+1.
Now, X+1, X+2,……,X+29, X+30 will be 31!+2,
31!+3, ……, 31!+30, 31!+31. From all these numbers,
we can take 2, 3, ……, 30 and 31 common respectively.
So, all these numbers are divisible by 2, 3, ……, 30 and
31 respectively and thus none of these numbers is prime.
Thus, number of primes among given numbers are zero.
61. Using formula for repeated dilution, Quantity of original
solution remaining = Total mixture (1 – Quantity
released/Total solution)No. of times
? 10% of total volume = 15% of total volume (1 –
x/10)2
? 10/15 = (1 – x/10)2
? v(2/3) = 1 – x/10
? x/10 = 1 - v(2/3)
? x = (1 – 0.81)×10 = 1.9 ˜ 2 litres
62. Number of triangle = 8c3 = 56
Number of quadrilateral = 8c4 = 70
? Required difference = 70 – 56 = 14
63. As 652 + 722 = 972 and 65 + 72 + 97 = 234
So other two sides of ? are 65 and 72.
64. Let D = 64
? C = 48
As B : C = 3 : 4
? B = 36
Also A : B = 3 : 4
? A = 27
So A : B : C : D
27 : 36 : 48 : 64
So C’s share = 1400
175
48 ? = 384Rs.
65. The opener will be I, as the author is asking a few
questions, starting with I, the next in sequence will be
III. After this V will come as the word ‘or’ shows
another question. The concluding sentence will be IV, as
in this sentence the speaker/author is stating something
different from the previously stated examples.
66. As per the statements, the story talks about ITC and the
lesson learnt by this company, therefore starting lines
would be sentence I. The word ‘solutions’ in I can be
linked with ‘solutions’ in III. After this V will come as
‘it’ refers to ITC and the approach adopted by it. The
word ‘also’ shows that other techniques adopted by ITC.
‘All these’ refers to ways and means adopted by ITC
therefore it will conclude the sequence.
67. The context tells that ‘freedom and prosperity’ would
spread gradually and as a result ‘tyranny and injustice’
would diminish continually. Neither it was gradually
thought nor through an orderly process was it thought.
So B and C rejected. Same goes with D, hence rejected.
68. The learning should be by the subject ‘he’ and ‘he’
should also recognize, what ancient India did, that…….
Also ancient Indian did not learn, on contrary they also

recognized what ‘he’ is supposed to recognize.
69. It is the case of vertical analogy as indefatigable means
‘tireless’ and inveterate means ‘habitual’.
70. ‘Misanthrope’ is one who hates ‘humanity’ similarly
‘misogynist’ is one who hates women.
71. ‘Vacillate’ is ‘to swing back and forth’. ‘Chagrin’ means
‘embarrassment due to disappointment. ‘Arrogate’
means ‘to seize without right’. ‘Conscript’ will go with
iii and ‘arraign’ will go with v.
72. ‘Ephemeral’ means ‘short lived’, ‘ethereal’ means
‘spiritual.’ ‘Chimera’ means ‘illusion’. ’Candour’ means
‘frankness’. ‘Aperitif’ means ‘I’.
73. With the pronoun ‘each’ the pronoun should be singular
hence D is correct. The possessive form of ‘one’ is
‘one’s and not ‘his’. After the conjunction ‘or’ the verb
is as per the second the second subject (shyam), which is
singular therefore ‘there’ is wrong’. Sentence ‘A’ is also
wrong because with ‘each’, ‘their’ is not used.
74. Two future tenses cannot be used together therefore
sentence B and C are wrong. ‘the placement of the word
‘both’ is wrong.
75. Between is used for 2 things or persons, Since is used
for starting point of an time, From is used to show what
the origin of somebody/something is, Among is used for
more than 2 things or persons and For is used to show a
length of time.
76. ‘Dint’ is by ‘means of something’; He succeeded by dint
of hard work.
‘Virtue’ is a ‘particular good quality or habit’, In 3rd
sentence ‘as a result of illness’, work could not be
finished;’ in case of’ it is equivalent to’ if it is required’.
77. Metaphor means a word or phrase used to describe
somebody/something else, in a way that is different
from its normal use, in order to show that the two things
have the same qualities. For e.g. Pen is the sword of
author
78. Oxymoron means a phrase that combines two words that
seem to be the opposite of each other, for example a
deafening silence.
79. The meaning of ‘Puerile’ is ‘Belonging to childhood’;
juvenile.
Immature; childish. Hence antonym is ‘Adult’.
80. Lacking in imagination and spirit; dull is the synonym.
Interesting is antonym.
81. ‘Exorbitant’ is the right word meaning ‘in excess of
what is reasonable’; excessive; extravagant; immoderate
82. The meaning the word is ‘acceptable’.
83. The meaning of ‘copious’ is ‘abundance’. This does not
match with the list as rest of the words mean ‘dangerous
or harmful’. .
84. The meaning of appreciate is ‘to be thankful or show
gratitude for’: To admire greatly; value. It does not
match with “propitiate”, ”appease”, ”Conciliate”
meaning make ‘peace with’ or satisfy, reconcile, placate,
pacify’.

Number of questions: 16
DIRECTIONS for questions 88 to 103: Read the following passages carefully and answer the questions at
the end of each passage.
Passage 1
Much remained a mystery about Bernie Madoff s crime, even after he pleaded guilty in March 2009. But one
thing, it seemed, that everybody knew was true was this: his wife and sons were guilty too. From the first
weeks after his arrest, unidentified "former prosecutors" and "criminal lawyers who have followed the case"
and "legal sources" were repeatedly quoted in various media outlets asserting that Ruth, Mark, and Andrew
Madoff were under investigation and would soon be indicted. Glossy magazine articles would speculate
carefully; garish Internet blogs would accuse recklessly; television commentators would wink and nod
knowingly. All that fierce, smug certainty about their guilt-unsupported by any cited facts-effectively drove
Madoff s immediate family into exile.
In an era of hypermedia, with mobile phone paparazzi and self-defined Internet commentators constantly on
the alert for ways to attract attention, it is worth noting that these attacks on the Madoff family were a sharp
departure from the typical public reaction to cases of white-collar crime, going back more than a century.
Of course, such criminals-confidence men, embezzlers, crooked politicians, fraudsters of all kinds-were
attacked savagely by the press and the public when their crimes came to light. But their wives and children
were almost never included in those attacks; rather they were almost always ignored or, at the very least,
quickly left alone. There were a few exceptions where criminal charges were actually filed against a close
relative, who was then pulled to the whipping post of public attention. In general, however, even the wives
and children of executed murderers were left to rebuild their lives in relative obscurity, unless they sought the
spotlight themselves.
The treatment over the years of organized-crime defendants is instructive. Despite widespread fascination
with the murderous escapades of so-called "Mafia dons" and crime-family "capos", it was extremely rare for
any attention to fall on the elderly Mrs. Mafia Don or the capos' children-even though a realist might have
wondered how much they knew about why their husband or father had asked all his closest buddies to wear
guns and sleep on mattresses in the garage. On rare occasions, a mobster's relatives actively courted publicity.
But those who didn't were routinely ignored by the media and certainly were never publicly and repeatedly
accused of complicity in their husbands' or fathers' crimes.
Yet the public outcry against Ruth Madoff and her sons began almost from the instant of Madoffs arrest and
did not cease. By the time he pleaded guilty, it was deafening.
From the beginning, however, there were facts in the Madotf case that just didn't seem to be consistent with
the family's guilt. First, there was the fact that none of them fled the country. Perhaps Bernie Madoff, seventy
years old at the time of his confession, felt too old and tired to leave as a wealthy fugitive; and perhaps Ruth,
even if she were guilty and faced arrest and a lifelong imprisonment, would not leave without him. But his
two sons, if they were guilty, had the opportunity, the means, and the motive to flee. The end was clearly in
sight weeks in advance, there was still a princely sum in the bank, and they and their families were relatively
young and portable. Surely, Madoff, before turning himself in, would have handed his sons the keys to the
company jet and enough cash to let them live comfortably beyond the reach of the law for the rest of their
lives. After all, if they were his accomplices, their only other option would have been to stay and go to prison.
And yet Madoff did not flee- and neither did his wife or sons.
Then, there was his confession. Some hostile theorists immediately argued that Madoff and his guilty sons
staged his confession so they could turn him in and thereby deflect suspicion from themselves. But this would
have been a worthless gesture unless they all could have been absolutely sure that no incriminating
www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c om 17
Bulls Eye IIFT PAPER 2013
evidence would surface later and none of their other low-levelaccomplices would finger the sons in a bid for
leniency-assumptions that were not remotely realistic if the sons were actually guilty. Moreover, if Madoff
truly believed anyone could be insulated from suspicion simply by turning himself in, wouldn't he have
arranged for that to be Ruth?
Logic aside, assumptions about the family's guilt began to run up against the fact that, as the Madoff
investigation progressed, the predicted arrests of his wife and sons simply did not happen.
88. According to the author, why did the wife and sons of Madoff not flee the country?
1. Because Bernie Madoff had already pleaded guilty
2. Because they did not have the opportunity and means to flee
3. Because they had deflected suspicion from themselves by turning Bernie Madoff in
4. None of the above
89. How did the family of Bernie Madoff react to media frenzy declaring them guilty?
1. They launched counter publicity to prove they were not guilty
2. They sued the media for defamation
3. They stayed away from public eye
4. They approached the media to confess their crime
90. What is the point the author has highlighted in the given passage?
1. That the Madoff crime came to light because of the dynamism of hypermedia
2. That the treatment over the years of organized-crime defendants has changed
3. That media tends to run parallel trials to the court
4. That families of criminals must also be indicted
91. Which of the following sentences is incorrect?
1. It was the facts about the Madoff case that indicated that his family was guilty
2. Madoff had been arrested following his confession
3. Media has always shown extensive interest in the exploits of mafia dons and other criminals
4. Madoff had committed a white-collar crime
Passage 2
Many years ago, one mustard dominated the supermarket shelves: French's. It came in a plastic bottle. People
used it on hot dogs and bologna. It was yellow mustard, made from ground white mustard seed with turmeric
and vinegar, which gave it a mild, slightly metallic taste. If you looked hard in the grocery store, you might
find something in the speciality-foods section called Grey Poupon, which was Dijon mustard, made from the
more pungent brown mustard seed. In the early seventies, Grey Poupon was no more than a hundredthousand-
dollar-a-year business. Few people knew what it was or how it tasted, or had any particular desire
for an alternative to French's or the runner-up, Gulden's. Then one day, the Heublein Company, which owned
Grey Poupon, discovered something remarkable: if you gave people a mustard taste test, a significant number
had only to try Grey Poupon once to switch from yellow mustard. In the food world that almost never
happens; even among the most successful food brands, only about one in a hundred has that kind of
conversion rate. Grey Poupon was magic.
So Heublein put Grey Poupon in a bigger glass jar, with an enamelled label and enough of a whiff of
Frenchness to make it seem as if it were still being made in Europe (it was made in Hartford, Connecticut,
from Canadian mustard seed and white wine). The company ran tasteful print ads in upscale food magazines.
They put the mustard in little foil packets and distributed them with airplane meals - which was a brand-new
IIFT PAPER 2013
18

www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c o m
idea at the time. Then they hired the Manhattan ad agency Lowe Marschalk to do something, on a modest
budget, for television. The agency came back with an idea: A Rolls-Royce is driving down a country road.
There's a man in the backseat in a suit with a plate of beef on a silver tray. He nods to the chauffeur, who
opens the glove compartment. Then comes what is known in the business world as the reveal. The chauffeur
hands back a jar of Grey Poupon. Another Rolls Royce pulls up alongside. A man leans his hand out of the
window. "Pardon me. Would you have any Grey Poupon?"
In the cities where the ads ran, sales of Grey Poupon leaped 40 to 50 percent, and whenever Heublein bought
airtime in new cities sales jumped 40 to 50 percent again. Grocery stores put Grey Poupon next to French's
and Gulden's. By the end of the 1980's Grey Poupon was the most powerful brand in mustard. "The tagline in
the commercial was that this was one of life's finer pleasures." Larry Elegant, who wrote the original Grey
Poupon spot, says, "and that, along with the Rolls Royce, seemed to impart to people's minds that this was
something truly different and superior."
The rise of Grey Poupon proved that the American supermarket shopper was willing to pay more - in this case
$3.99 instead of $1.49 for eight ounces - as long as what they were buying carried with it an air of
sophistication and complex aromatics. Its success showed, furthermore, that the boundaries of taste and
custom were not fixed: that just because mustard had always been yellow didn't mean that customers would
use only yellow mustard. It is because of Grey Poupon that the standard American supermarket today has an
entire mustard section. And it is because of Grey Poupon that a man named Jim Wigon decided, four years
ago, to enter the ketchup business. Isn't the ketchup business today exactly where mustard was thirty years
ago? There is Heinz and, far behind, Hunt's and Del Monte and a handful of private label brands. Jim Wagon
wanted to create the Grey Poupon of ketchup.
Wigon is/from Boston. He runs his ketchup business-under the brand World's Best Ketchup-out of the
catering business of his partner, Nich Schiarizzi, in Norwood, Massachusetts. He starts with red peppers,
Spanish onions, garlic, and a high-end tomato paste. Basil is chopped by hand, because the buffalo chopper
bruises the leaves. He uses maple syrup, not corn syrup, which gives him a quarter of the sugar of Heinz. He
pours his ketchup into a clear ten-ounce jar, and sells its for three times the price of Heinz, and for the past
few years he has crisscrossed the country, peddling World's Best in six flavours- regular, sweet, dill, garlic,
caramelized onion, and basil - to speciality grocery stores and supermarkets. If you were in Zabar's on
Manhattan's Upper West Side a few months ago, you would have seen him at the front of the store, in the spot
between the sushi and the gefilte fish. In front of him, on a small table, was a silver tureen filled with
miniature chicken and beef meatballs, a box of toothpicks, and a dozen or so open jars of his ketchup. "Try
my ketchup!" Wigon said, over and over, to anyone who passed. "If you don't try it, you're doomed to eat
Heinz the rest of your life."
In the same aisle at Zabar's that day two other demonstrations were going on, so that people were starting at
one end with free chicken sausage, sampling a slice of prosciutto, and then pausing at the World's Best stand
before heading for the cash register. They would look down at the array of open jars, and Wigon would impale
a meatball on a toothpick, dip it in one of his ketchups, and hand it to them with a flourish. The ratio of tomato
solids to liquid in World's Best is much higher than in Heinz, and the maple syrup gives it an unmistakable
sweet kick. Invariably, people would close their eyes, just for a moment, and do a subtle double take. Some of
them would look slightly perplexed and walk away, and others would nod and pick up ajar. "You know why
you like it so much?" he would say, in his broad Boston accent, to the customers who seemed most impressed.
"Because you have been eating bad ketchup all your life!" Jim Wigon had a simple vision: build a better
ketchup - the way Grey Poupon built a better mustard - and the world will beat a path to your door.
92. Why has the author termed Grey Poupon as "magic"?
1. It had a different taste and was seen as belonging to specialty-foods division
2. It was made from Dijon mustard
3. It commanded a conversion rate uncommon in the food world

Passage 3
To equate 'capitalism' with 'greed' is a mistake. We tend to confuse self-interest in the marketplace with
selfishness or greed. At the heart of capitalism is the idea of exchange between ordinary, self-interested
human beings, who seek to advance their interests peacefully in the marketplace. Adam Smith called this
'rational self-interest'. It is the same motive that gets one to jump out of bed in the morning or makes one carry
an umbrella if it rains—nothing selfish about that. To be human is to be self-interested, and this is what
exchange in the market place entails.
Greed or selfishness, on the other hand, is an excess of self interest and often transgresses on the rights of
others. It is present in all of us, but we find it easier to see it in others and difficult to see it in ourselves. Greed
can motivate theft, entail himsa—hurting another whose opposite, ahimsa, is a virtue that Mahatma Gandhi
extolled. But the other side of greed is ambition, a positive thing, and when rightly directed, is life-affirming.
Herein lies the conundrum of human existence: that the same inner forces that result in a vice can just as
easily become virtues that can motivate the well-being of our species.
Those who believe that capitalism has been forced on us by the imperial West are also wrong. Friedrich
Hayek, the Noble laureate, called the market a spontaneous order—it is natural for human beings to exchange
goods and services, and this is how every society evolved money, laws, conventions and morals to guide
behaviour in the marketplace. These are natural products of human endeavour. Competing and cooperating in
the marketplace existed in India before the West was imperial or modern.
Whether we like it or not, India is headed in the direction of some sort of democratic capitalism. After two
decades of reforms, hardly anyone in India wants state ownership of production, where the absence of
competition corrodes the character even more, as we know too well from the dark days of the 'license raj' .
Our animus against capitalism has diminished after communism's fall as people increasingly believe mat
markets do deliver greater prosperity, but most think that capitalism is not a moral system. They continue to
believe that morality must depend on religion.
Although the market is neither moral nor immoral, human self-interest usually brings about good behaviour in
the marketplace. A seller who does not treat his customers with fairness and civility will lose market share A
company that markets defective products will lose customers. A firm that does not promote the most
deserving employees will lose talent to its competitors. A buyer who does not respect the market price will not
survive. Lying and cheating will ruin a firm's image, making it untouchable to creditors and suppliers. Hence,
free markets offer powerful incentives for ethical conduct, but they must be backed by state institutions that
enforce contracts and punish criminal behaviour. If the market has an inbuilt morality, why are there so many
crooks in the marketplace? The answer is that there are crooked people in every society, and this is why we
IIFT PAPER 2013
20
Bulls Eye
www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c o m
need effective regulators, policemen and judges. We should design our institutions to catch crooks and not
harass innocent people as we do so often.
The other cause of our grief is to mistake being 'pro-market' with being 'pro-business'. To be 'pro-market' is to
believe in competitive markets which help to keep prices low and gradually raise the quality of products.
Competition also means that some businesses will die because they are poorly managed and cannot compete.
Kingfisher Airlines and Air India should be allowed to die and not be bailed out by the government. Thus,
being pro-market leads to 'rules-based capitalism'; 'pro-business' often leads to 'crony capitalism'. Not to have
explained this difference has been the great mistake of our reformers and this has led to the false impression
that the reforms only make the rich richer. Crony capitalism exists in India today because of the lack of
reforms in sectors such as mining and real estate. To get rid of crony capitalism we need more rather than less
reform.
The doom-mongers, who claim that we are now resigned to live in an age of decaying moral standards, are
also wrong. Yes, the new Indian middle class is permissive and indulges enthusiastically in harmless
pleasures. Yes, it is materialistic, consumerist and capitalistic. But these impulses are not to be mistaken for
greed. Only when one's pleasure hurts another does it become a matter of the law (and then, of course, it must
be punished. The shared imagination of the new India with its harmless pleasure and victimless vice should
not be condemned. Think of ours as a society in transition. Mass wealth is profoundly disturbing but once
there is enough, India might again return to its old character of renunciation.
Instead of religious rules, young Indians are motivated by duties to fellow human beings rather than to gods.
Those who accuse them of shallow materialism ignore the injustices that prevailed when religion held a
monopoly on morality. They overlook real ethical progress with regard to sexual and caste equality that our
secular society has begun to deliver. So, the next time Kejriwal makes an expose and the TV screams 'greed',
do not fall into the trap of believing capitalist culture is morally sick or that we should return to a moral order
rooted in socialism or religion.

Passage 4
Brazil is a top exporter of every commodity that has seen dizzying price surges -iron ore, soybeans, sugar -
producing a golden age for economic growth. Foreign money-flows into Brazilian stocks and bonds climbed
heavenward, up more than tenfold, from $5 billion a year in early 2007 to more than $50 billion in the twelve
months through March 2011.
The flood of foreign money buying up Brazilian assets has made the currency one of the most expensive in the
world, and Brazil one of the most costly, overhyped economies. Almost every major emerging-market
currency has strengthened against the dollar over the last decade, but the Brazilian Real is on a path alone,
way above the pack, having doubled in value against the dollar.
Economists have all kinds of fancy ways to measure the real value of a currency, but when a country is pricing
itself this far out of the competition, you can feel it on the ground. In early 2011 the major Rio paper, O
Globo, ran a story on prices showing that croissants are more expensive than they are in Paris, haircuts cost
more than they do in London, bike rentals are more expensive than in Amsterdam, and movie tickets sell for
higher prices than in Madrid. A rule of the road: if the local prices in an emerging market country feel
expensive even to a visitor from a rich nation, that country is probably not a breakout nation.
There is no better example of how absurd it is to lump all the big emerging markets together than the frequent
pairing of Brazil and China. Those who make this comparison are referring only to the fact that they are the
biggest players in their home regions, not to the way the economies actually run. Brazil is the world's leading
exporter of many raw materials, and China is the leading importer; that makes them major trade partners -
China surpassed the United States as Brazil's leading trade partner in 2009 -but it also makes them opposites
in almost every important economic respect: Brazil is the un-China, with interest rates that are too high, and a
currency that is too expensive. It spends too little on roads and too much on welfare, and as a result has a very
un-Chiria-like growth record.
It may not be entirely fair to compare economic growth in Brazil with that of its Asian counterparts, because
Brazil has a per capita income of $12,000, more than two times China's and nearly ten times India's. But even
taking into account the fact that it is harder for rich nations to grow quickly, Brazil's growth has been
disappointing. Since the early 1980s the Brazilian growth rate has oscillated around an average of 2.5 percent,
spiking only in concert with increased prices for Brazil's key commodity exports.
While China has been criticized for pursuing "growth at any cost," Brazil has sought to secure "stability at any
cost." Brazil's caution stems from its history of financial crises, in which overspending produced debt,
humiliating defaults, and embarrassing devaluations, culminating in a disaster that is still recent enough to be
fresh in every Brazilian adult's memory: the hyperinflation that started in the early 1980s and peaked in 1994,
at the vertiginous annual rate of 2,100 percent.
Wages were pegged to inflation but were increased at varying intervals in different industries, so workers
never really knew whether they were making good money or not. As soon as they were paid, they literally ran
to the store with cash to buy food, and they could afford little else, causing non-essential industries to start to
die. Hyperinflation finally came under control in 1995, but it left a problem of regular inflation behind. Brazil
has battled inflation ever since by maintaining one of the highest interest rates in the emerging world. Those
high rates have attracted a surge of foreign money, which is partly why the Brazilian Real is so expensive
relative to comparable currencies.

There is a growing recognition that China faces serious "imbalances" that could derail its long economic
boom. Obsessed until recently with high growth, China has been pushing too hard to keep its currency too
cheap (to help its export industries compete), encouraging excessively high savings and keeping interest rates
rock bottom to fund heavy spending on roads and ports. China is only now beginning to consider a shift in
spending priorities to create social programs that protect its people from the vicissitudes of old age and
unemployment.
Brazil's economy is just as badly out of balance, though in opposite ways. While China has introduced
reforms relentlessly for three decades, opening itself up to the world even at the risk of domestic instability,
Brazil has pushed reforms only in the most dire circumstances, for example, privatizing state companies when
the government budget is near collapse. Fearful of foreign shocks, Brazil is still one of the most closed
economies in the emerging world -total imports and exports account for only 15 percent of GDP - despite its
status as the world's leading exporter of sugar, orange juice, coffee, poultry, and beef.
To pay for its big government, Brazil has jacked up taxes and now has a tax burden that equals 38 percent of
GDP, the highest in the emerging world, and very similar to the tax burden in developed European welfare
states, such as Norway and France. This heavy load of personal and corporate tax on a relatively poor country
means that businesses don't have the money to invest in new technology or training, which in turn means that
industry is not getting more efficient. Between 1980 and 2008 Brazil's productivity grew at an annual rate of
about 0.2 percent, compared to 4 percent in China. Over the same period, productivity grew in India at close
to 3 percent and in South Korea and Thailand at close to 2 percent.
100. According to the passage, the major concern facing the Brazil economy is:
1. Despite being a major exporter of several key primary commodities, the openness of the economy
has not improved.
2. High tax incidence on the household and company incomes, which restricts the ability of the firms
to facilitate innovation and skill formation.
3. Insufficient spending of budgetary resources on infrastructure augmentation, which hurts economic
interests.
4. All of the above
101. Brazil's quest for stability in its economy has originated from:
1. The bitter experience of financial crisis and hyperinflation in the nineties
2. The need to maintain steady supply of commodity exports from its economy
3. The urge to enhance economic growth further
4. All of the above
102. Identify the false statement:
1. The Brazilian government in the past has shown lesser inclination towards quick implementation of
reform measures.
2. The inflow of foreign currency in Brazil has increased by around US $ 45 Billion over the four-year
period starting from 2007.
3. The annual productivity growth rate in China during 1980-2008 is found to be 20 times higher than
the corresponding figure experienced by Brazil.
4. The current inflation management practice of Brazil has provided its economy a significant edge
vis-a-vis other countries.
103. According to the passage, Brazil does not seem to be an exporter of which commodity combination?
1. Poultry and beef 2. Iron ore and soybeans
3. Croissants and bikes 4. Sugar, orange juice and coffee

EXPLANATIONS
1. Going according to the options
A) Services Sector = 20.8 – 18.2 = 2.6
B) Construction = 10.5 – 7.6 = 2.9
C) Automobile = 4.9 – 1.9 = 3
D) Power = 3.2 – 1.3 = 1.9
Thus, the Highest increase in FDI share is for
Automobile Industry.
2. The Simple average share of FDI in flows can be
calculated as =

Sum of values for all years But
since, we need to calculate the lowest value, so
calculating only the sum of values will be sufficient.
By totaling, it can be checked that the lowest value is
for Drugs & Pharmaceuticals, while the second
lowest is for Automobile Industry.
3. By visual inspection, it can be verified that only
option (D) is FALSE.
4. By doing ranking for the given options, it can be
visually checked that (i) & (ii) are true while (iii) is
false. Thus, correct answer is (B).
5. A) Telecommunications sector (2007 & 2008) = 8.3 -
5.5 = 2.8
B) Computer Software & Hardware (2009 & 2010) =
4.7 – 2.5 = 2.2
C) Automobile Sector (2011 & 2012) = 4.9 – 2.5 =
2.4
D) Power Sector (2007 & 2008) = 3.9 – 1.3 = 2.6
Thus, the highest figure for increase in FDI inflow
share is for Telecommunication Sector.

North African region = | 1.59 – 1.75 | = 0.16
Thus, the highest year-to-year decline in absolute
terms is for North African region for the given period.
7. It can be visually checked that there are 6, 6, 7 and 6
declines respectively for the given options. Thus,

Thus, the highest percentage is for industry 7.
15. A is false as number of workers per factory is third
highest for industry 5 and are 96
B is false as expense on Material consumption
expressed as a percentage of Input cost is second
highest for Industry 5 i.e. 88.1%
C is false as Profit earned as a percentage of
emolument is second highest for Industry 4 and is
38%
D is True as emolument as a percentage of net value
added is lowest for industry 5 and is 12.94%
16. The ranking in terms of numbers of days to start a
business as defined in the question happens to be
Paraguay-rank 1, UK–rank 2, Chile-rank3. Now out
of these the least cost to per capita income ratio will
be the same as the percentage given. It is 2.6 for
Paraguay, 4.1 for UK and 35.8 for Chile. Hence
answer will be Paraguay.
17. For UK = No. of days for export to import
= 13: 17 = 0.76
UAE = 11: 14 = 0.78
Chile = 23:25 = 0.92
Georgia = 22:23 = 0.96
Thus, the least ratio for export to import is for UK.
18. By observing the information in the given graph, it
can be checked that in Gerorgia, the no. of days
required for exporting is lower than the number of
days required for importing.
19. As we need to check the false statement in the
question. Each statement should be checked one by
one. In the first statement the number of days happens
to be 15 for Chile and 16 for Tanzania. So this
statement is true. Similarly second statement is also
true. When we check the time for import in Georgia it
is 23 days. The time for export in Niger is 25 days.
The time in Georgia is less, whereas in the third
statement that is given to be higher. Hence 3rd
statement is False.
20-
25.
With the statement given in the question :
With statement j : MERCURY __ PLUTO __ MARS
With statement i = Mercury is at the odd position
hence Mercury can only be at room number 201
With statement d : Uranus and professor in room 206
is compared , hence Uranus cannot be in 206 , and
with k statement Jupiter cannot be in room number
206 , hence Neptune is in room number 206
Professor in 202 published twice journals then the
professor who donated to 8 institution i.e. Pluto hence
professor in 202 published 24 journals.
If the journals published by Uranus is 24 then by
statement D then the number of journals published by
Neptune would be 40 – 24 = 16 and by statement H
the journals denoted by Neptune would be 16. Hence
following tables can be drawn.

20. Hence Mars is in Room No. 205. Option C.
21. Hence Jupiter professor donate 18. Option C.
22. Hence the professor of Neptune institute stay in room
number 206. Option D.
23. Hence the professor of Uranus institute donated to 24
institutions last year. Option B.
24. Hence the professor of Uranus institute published in
the maximum number of journals. Option B.
25. Hence the Jupiter professor published 4 journals.
Option B.

As per Statements
26. If the first letter is consonant and last letter is vowel,
both are coded as O.
Hence the correct answer is option D.
27. A R F T H E
If Both the First and last letter and vowel, then both
are coded as last letter
Hence the answer is option A.

If P – Q ? Q is the Father of P.
All other option defined the one generation Relation
i.e. Sister, Wife, Brother
None of the option have two symbols ( - )
Hence answer is option D.
29. By Question
S Q P T R
Hence the House in the middle is P i.e. option A.
30. As stated in the passage ‘Asatra Vriksh has a fleshy
and Poisnous Fruit, hence people should not eat the
fruit of the Asatra Vriksh i.e. option C.
31. Comparing the first two sentence given, the code for
‘poisonous’ (the only common word) happens to be
‘crenia’ (the only common code). For the remaining
words from these two sentences the code can be
found. For the word ‘spider’ the code will become
‘agnos’ and for the word ‘snake’ the code will
become ‘delano’. On the same logic from the third
sentence the code for the word ‘brown’ can be found
as ‘deery’. Now for answering the question the code
for “black widow spider” the code known is only for
the word ‘spider’. So the answer must have the code
‘agnos’ in it. Now out of second and third options it
cannot be third, as that contains the code ‘delano’,
which is the code for the word ‘snake’. Hence the
answer has to be option 2nd.
32. The given argument is flawed because of the
‘percentage fallacy’, according to which, merely
equating the numbers, one cannot judge the
efficiency/inefficiency of the conclusion drawn. So
here also the number of youth in both the areas is
given and it is not given ‘out of how many or total
number of ‘youth in the respective areas. Therefore
unless we are given percentage of both the areas
studied. We cannot comment upon the usefulness of
the ‘getting education’.
33-
35.
P&S are unmarried ladies
T is the husband that means (he is Male)
Q is the brother of R. Hence Q is male and R is the
wife of T.
Hence
33. By above. The ladies in the group – PSR – Hence D is
correct.
34. Tennis Player – R – Married lady. Hence correct
answer is option B.
35. Wife of T – R. Hence correct answer is option D.
36. Angle between clock is 500. Hence answer B.
37. Substituting options :-
4th c a b b a c c a b b a c c a b b a c is the
repetitive pattern of c a b b a c
38. B2 C D , ________ BC D4 _________ BC6 D
As we can see the Number in the next is increasing
and changing the position alphabetically.
B2 C D, BC3 D, BCD4 B5 CD, BC6 D
Hence Answer is option 1
39. P3, M8, ________ G24, D35
we can see that Number are increasing
= 3 8 ____ 24 35
The space should contain 15 as difference is
increasing
8-3 = 5
15-8 = 7
24-15 =9
35-24 = 11
Similarly Position of M and P has the difference 3
Hence J 15 i.e. option is the correct answer
68. Anthromorphous means To resemble human form (c)
Anchronistic comes from an- chron , where chron
means time , Therefore it will mean occurring in
wrong time (d) Anthology; logy means study and
antho means collection of extracts from the writings
of various authors (b) Ascension means moving
upwards (a)
69. Caco is root which indicated words/sounds therefore
option (d) Ethology is study of human behavior,
therefore option (a) Miso indicates hatred therefore
option (d) Cryo means icy cold therefore option (b)
70. The word ‘envisages means
’’To contemplate; visualize, imagine, conceive, envisi
on’’. In all the sentences future is being talked about
so option B fits the best in all the sentences
71. The word ‘provide’ has following meanings:
to make available; furnish:
to supply or equip: to afford or yield.
to arrange for or stipulate beforehand, as by a provisi
onto prepare or procure beforehand.
To make arrangements for supplying means of
support to the family/anybody
Therefore option D can fill all the blanks
72. Statement (ii) is a general statement introducing the
topic “singing Bengali songs’. Moreover it uses
proper name. Then Statement (i) is extension as it
mentioned the kind of songs she sings. (iii) and (iv)
are mandatory pair in which usage of “instead” tells
(iii) will follow(iv)
73. The code here is “the sequence of day & activities.
Statement (iii) is a general statement which tells
about an “afternoon” and it mentions “we in a room”
Then statement (i) will come as it talks about dusk
and “Adele runs away”. Logically (iv) will follow as
“after adele runs away….left alone” And then the day
progress and “twilight” is mentioned.
74. Alleviate means “to reduce” whereas aggravate
means “to enhance” These are opposites and hence
opposite of elastic is rigid
75. Benevolent means” well meaning and kindly” thus it
is same meaning as kind. Therefore the same meaning
of unclear will be “muddy”
76. A person who knows or can speak many languages is
polyglot.
Plebiscite is “the direct vote of all the members of an
electorate on an important public question”
Paramour means “a lover, esp. the illicit partner of a
married person”
77. Culpable is one who “deserves blame/guilty”.
Hedonist is “a pleasure-seeker”. Misanthrope is “one
who hates mankind” Regicide is “to kill a king”
78. To have a jaundiced eye means to “to be
prejudiced/biased”
79. One’s bearing is one’s position; Hence to lose one’s
bearings is to be uncertain of one’s position.
80. As per the nearest subject rule, if two different

nearest subject. Here the second subject is ‘shikha’,
which is singular, therefore singular helping verb ’is’
in place of plural helping verb ‘are’.
81. A is incorrect because of ‘they’ in the second half.
We will use ‘she’ with each as each of is treated to be
singular. B is incorrect because of ‘their’ and ‘they’
in second half as the reason given above (each of is
treated as singular) D is incorrect because abandoning
is a one time process and ill treatment can be
continuous. we can only use ‘had been’ with a
continuous process. Therefore only C is correct
82. As busy as a be is a simile because it is a
comparison..bee is very hard working and that
implies comparison.
83. Amelioration is spelled with only one ‘m’ Others are
correct
84. Gazette has only one ‘t’
85. Apocryphal means fictitious
Authentic means real
Audacious means adventurous
Blasphemous means speaking ill against a religion
Therefore the correct antonym is authentic which is
opposite of fiction
86. Capricious means fickle minded
Crafty means smart or calculative
Erratic means abnormal
Consistent means dependable
So the answer is consistent which means constant
87. It is a past continuous tense and while converting it
into passive. That is why the one with ‘were being’ is
correct. C and D are incorrect as there is no need of
‘had been’B is incorrect as it has ‘were’ which is
incorrect as we need continuous passive.
88. The family had every means to flee the country, so
option B is rejected. Option c is rejected as it was the
assumption made by some hostile theorist. Option A
is rejected as it has nothing to do his family staying or
leaving the country.
89. No mention of option A, in the passage, so rejected.
Option b is out of scope, therefore rejected. They did
not approach the media to confess their crime, so
option D is also rejected. They even didn’t the media,
so option B is also rejected.
90. As per the passage. ‘’madoff’s case was sharp
departure from the reality as his family was also
criticized for their involvement in crime. In fourth
Para, also the author says that ‘the treatment, over the
years of organized –crime defendants, is instructive
…. , Even though the court did not find anything
against the madoff’s family, yet the media right from
the start pointed fingers at Madoff’s family.
91. The lines ‘’from the beginning, however, there were
facts in the Madoff’s case that just didn’t seem to be
consistent with the family’s guilt. So it is clear that
media tends to run parallel trial court.
92. From the last lines of the 1st paragraph it is clear that
‘Grey Poupon was magic’ because it could make
several people switch over to using its product, which
was almost impossible to achieve.
93. 7th line of the 1st paragraph talks about the period of
early 1970s when Grey Poupon was not popular.
Then 4th line of the 3rd paragraph states that by end of
1980s it became a successful brand. So this span
roughly comes out to be of 15- 20 years.
94. There are a lot of hints in the paragraph that the ads
focused on upscale customers. For instance 4th line
2nd paragraph states “ the company ran tasteful print
ads in upscale food magazines”.
95. The line of the last paragraphs clearly justifies the
answer. “The ratio of tomato solids to liquid in
world’s ………”.
96. For A refer to last few lines of first passage and also
Adam smith calls it rational self interest.to be human
is self interested , self interest is like carrying
umbrella when it rains.these lines support the idea in
B
For B Refer to passage 2 line 4 , it clearly written that
“greed entails ahimsa whose opposite is ahimsa” ..not
greed entails both A & C are out of context.
97. Refer to 3rd last line of second paragraph “here lies
the conundrum” which means the mystery or enigma
That is why A is correct.
98. Refer to last two lines of second last paragraph “Mass
wealth………………………….”
It is clearly given that mass wealth is distributing but
once there is enough , India might return to old
character of renunciation.
99. Last 3 lines of the 6th paragraph states that “crony
Capitalism exists in India today because of the lack of
reforms in sectors such as mining and real estate. To
get rid of ………….”
Thus option 2 is incorrect because it states the
opposite.
100. Option A is a major concern as it is mentioned in
paragraph 9 “Brazil’s economy is badly out of
balance……brazil is closed economy….total imports
& exports account for only 15% of GDP.
Option B is also a concern as mentioned in paragraph
10 “jacked up taxes…..businesses do not have money
to invest in new technology”
Option C is mentioned din para 4 “it spends too little
on road”
101. It is the only reason directly mentioned in paragraph 6
“ Brazil has sought security at any cost………the
hyperinflation ….” Rest of the options are mentioned
but are not the direct reason for need for stability.
102. Option B is right as mentioned in paragraph 1
“Foreign money inflow……climbed
heavenward…..from $5 billion in 2007 to more than
$50 billion …in march 2011” Hence $45 billion in 4
years.
Option C is right as mentioned in 10th para “Between
1980 and 2008 Brazil’s productivity grew at an
annual rate of 0.2 % compared to 4 % of china” it
Makes it 20 times. Option D is right as mentioned in
7 para “Brazil has battled inflation by maintaining
one of the highest interest rates”
103. All the products mentioned Except Croissants and
bikes are explicitly mentioned as exports in the
passage. While talking of Croissants and bikes in Para
3, author tells only about the fact that these are highly
priced items as compared to their foreign
counterparts.

105. If the product of bc is 91 then we have bc = 7 × 13.
Also in this case ad = 34 so that a × d = 2 × 17
? the order of a, b, c and d is 2, 7, 13, 17.
106. As no definite number is being given, the question is
to be answered by taking each of the options one by
one. Taking the first option, the total expenditure
happens to be 21* 3.30 + 57*2.90 = 234.6. Trying the
second option the expenditure happens to be 57 *3.30
+ 21 *2.90 = 249. Hence second option is the answer.
107. Answer should be Data inconsistent as sum of two
sides of triangle should be greater then third side and
none of the options satisfies this criteria.

120. In the first case they finish half the work in 30 min. or
they will finish the work in one hour. So they work
one hour each in the first case. In the second case,
they work the elder for 1 hour and the younger for 4
hours. Equating the two cases implies whatever
younger son does in three hours the mother does in
one hour. The time taken by younger son is thrice the
time taken by the mother. Now if mother takes M
hours, younger son will take 3M hour and the elder
son will take M+1 hours, as given in the question.
Now they are finishing the work in one hour implies
the following equation. .
Solving this equation, we get M = 2. So mother takes
2 hours, elder son takes 3 and younger son takes 6
hours. Thus in one hour mother does 50% of work.

IIFT Paper-2014
Answer key
Set
A
key Explanations
1. B The last line of the 7th paragraph clearly mentions the fact of Manchester United spending double the amount as
done by Aston Villa.
Option C- The research only talks of the total team bill. It says nothing about the wages paid tro individual
footballers.
Option D- The Guardian has collaborated with Opta sports to publish the data (9th paragraph), which has been used
by the writer.
2. D Please refer to the 13th paragraph of the passage, which clearly mentions this figure.
3. D
4. C All the typical characteristics of guerilla warfare have been mentioned in the last few lines of the closing
paragraph. Note the words – lie in wait, unpredictable etc. being employed here to highlight the style adopted by
the team.
5. A The data, as mentioned in the 6th paragraph, pertains to the last twenty years and not a decade. The rest of the
options contain correct statements.
6. C 4th paragraph 5th line clearly mentions that his command over the two languages was tenuous i.e. weak. Option A is
clearly mentioned in 4th last paragraph; in fact this paragraph deals with his visits to country side for shooting
purpose. 1st paragraph mentions that he relished his power over the upper classes such as Brahmins who use to
dominate his community in the past; this clearly means that he was not a Brahmin. Last few lines of the 3rd
paragraph mentions that the judge Jemubhai was noosed by the money lenders and they are still waiting for their
repayments.
7. B in the paragraph on 5.30 pm the line ‘ one thing was always missing, though, …………..Nothing!’ suggests that he
could not shoot even a single creature ever while shooting on the country side.
8. A in the paragraph on 8.30 am the 4th line suggests that the yield per acre was very less and in the same line its
mentioned that people were in debt.
9. A This is a tricky question because according to the passage the meaning of Lariat seems to be a flock of birds. But
actually Lariat means a rope used for tying something.
Brood means ‘thinking or contemplating about something or a family of birds or other young animals produced at
one hatching or birth. Flock and flight are both used for referring to group of birds. That’s why odd one out is
Lariat.
10. D The 12th paragraph in the passage describes the fact of garibaldi urging his wife to stay back, without any success.
Read the line the pair set off with 200 loyal soldiers.
11. C Please refer to the last line of the closing paragraph – He visited his family in Nice for an emotional reunion ……
The rest of the options contain either incorrect inferences or are simply restatements of the facts given in the
passage.
12. A Clearly mentioned in the first paragraph itself that Charles Albert was the King of Piedmont and Louis Philippe
was toppled from the French throne.
13. B One can easily locate the answer from the second-last paragraph which says …. He and his faithful companion
Leggero escaped….
14. A The rest of the options are duly mentioned in the passage at different places.
15. A The very first line of the 3rd paragraph clearly states this answer.
16. C Option A can be found out in the first line of the 3rd paragraph.
Option B is clearly mentioned in 5th line of the 8th paragraph. ‘ Basel three norms…….’.
Option D 1st line of the 6th paragraph clearly establishes this option.
17. D The starting of the passage suggests that because of tightened capital flow the banks are forced to loan out money
only to PSUs and 1st grade companies. They want to lower their risks by not lending to smaller companies. Capital
adequacy is mentioned in the 8th paragraph. The 3rd last paragraph suggests narrowing gap between yields on
advances and cost of deposit.
18. C The paragraph should start with sentence-III as it gives the reason for Milner’s interest in investing money in
facebook. His valuation of the company stands at 10$. Sentence-II presents the comparison of Milner’s valuation
with the valuation done by Microsoft and Li, which stands at a higher value i.e., 15$. Further, in sentence-I, it is
revealed that doubts linger about Facebook’s ability to be a business as financial markets had also fallen since the
Microsoft’s deal. In sentence-IV the first word ‘but’ shows that despite prevailing doubts, Milner is enthusiastic
about investing as much as $300 million in facebook.
19. D The paragraph should start with sentence-IV as the author is narrating his story and this sentence gives us the
background of what he is about to say next. The pronoun ‘him’ in sentence-II refers to Schubert, hence it should
follow. Also, this sentence tells about soundproof cell which is justified in sentence-I which takes the narration
further by saying that no light or sound enter the ‘soundproof cell’. Now, since there is no light or sound from the
world, the only things which create impression of sense are ‘electrons’ and ‘horsehair’, mentioned in sentence-III.
20. A The correct spellings are decrepit; it means something worn out or neglected.
21. B Correct spellings are receive, perceive, deceive and believe.
22. C Solicitude means care or concern for something. There is no word with spellings solictitude. Chivalry means
courteous, moral, religious etc. there is no word with the spellings chivelry.

The context of the statement is about a woman taking care of a patient. So answer has to be solicitude.
23. A Prevarication means evasive language. Insinuation means an unpleasant hint or suggestion of something bad.
Perambulation means to travel over. Abrogation means to cancel.
In the context of the given statement prevarication is the most suitable option as the sentence is about a person
evading somebody’s question about how long will she live.
24. D D is the most concise statement of all as it rightly states ‘new and interesting assignments.’ Rest of the options
unnecessary stretches the modifier.
25. D The question calls for selecting an option that makes right comparison and keeps the structure parallel.
Option A is wrong because the two parts ‘their Face wash did’ and ‘their anti ageing cream sales’ is not parallel;
instead of sales it should have been did only.
Option B is wrong because of the same reasons as mentioned for option A.
Option C is wrong because it should have been ‘20% more than their face wash did’; ‘did’ is missing, that’s why it
leads to a wrong comparison.
Option D makes right comparison and keeps the structure parallel.
26. C Mumble means not speaking clearly. Mumbling leads to unclear and indistinct conversation. The option that is
closest in the relationship to this is option C as scribbling leads to illegible handwriting. Rest of the options is
related in some different manner.
27. B Ruffle means disorder or disarrange. Equanimity means calm and composed. Ruffle and equanimity are almost
antonyms as a disordered mind opposite is a calm mind. The only option that has this antonymous relationship is B.
28. D 1.Having started iii. with just $5.8 million v. in seed financing, iv you squandered (wasted in foolish or reckless
manner) ii more than half of your capital i. in less time than it takes 6. to soft-boil an egg.
29. D 1. You could behave badly, say you were sorry, iv. you would get extra fun and be reinstated ii. in the same
position v. as the one who had done nothing i. who now had both to suffer the crime iii and the difficulty of
forgiving 6 with no goodies in addition at all.
30. A Option B is wrong because the verb ‘met’ is in the past tense and ‘meet’ is in the present tense. They should ideally
be in the same tense. Option C violates parallelism; instead of inspiration it should have been inspiring. Option D
misses a preposition ‘in’ after speak.
31. C Option A uses wrong tense; it should have been ‘to have fled the country’. Option B spoils parallelism; ‘by’ with
plane was not required. Option D would have been better with the inclusion of ‘for’ before my neighbor.
32. A Banish, expatriate and exile mean ‘to be thrown or sent out of one’s own country’. Expiate means make amends or
reparation for (guilt or wrongdoing).
33. B Brevity, Conciseness and succinctness mean to the point or to express something in less words. Circumlocution
means the use of many words where fewer would do, especially in a deliberate attempt to be vague or evasive.
34. B The standard quotation is ‘the bigger they come, the harder they fall’; it means.
35. D The correct preposition is ‘out of’ in this case. Rest of the options don’t make any sense
36. B ELATE, LATELY, LATE, TALE, YALE
37. C ENATE, THAN, HEATHEN, HEAT, NEAT, THAN, TANH, HATE, EATEN
38. B The candidate will not be selected as her age on January 26 , 2008 was 25 years and on January 26,2014 she was of
31 years of age. So she did not fulfill the first condition.
39. B The candidate will not be selected as he is working in a weekly newspaper and not a daily one.
40. C The candidate satisfies condition I, III and V. Since she did not score 60% marks in her graduation but scored 82%
marks in Post graduation, her case will be referred to the Chairman.
41. A Since candidate satisfy conditions I, II, III and IV, he will be selected
42. D The first letter in each subsequent term is increased by 2, e.g. E becomes G, G becomes I, So I will become k…
The second letter remains P, The third letter again increases by 2, e.g. F becomes H, H becomes J, J becomes
L….The last letter remain S. So the answer is KPLS.

Wednesday--- W1, W2 and W5
Thursday----- W1, W2
Friday----- W2
So maximum is on Wednesday. Hence option B
48. D Only on Saturday one window is open at any time.
49. A All windows are closed for one between 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM only on Wednesday.
50. C From the given information, the order in which they deliver the speeches is Mr. D’souza , Mr. Arora, Mr.Puri, Mr.
Kaare, Mr. Sethi, Mr. Tondon, Mr. Bisht , Mr. Reddy. So, Mr. puri delivered his address before Mr. Reddy
51. D From the given information the order in which they delivered the speeches is Mr. D’souza , Mr Arora, Mr. Bisht ,
Mr. Reddy.. Since Mr. Reddy is managing director of spearhead unlimited and there are two MD’s who will speak
after, Mr. Reddy, we cannot definitely say who will be the last CEO to speak among Mr. Sethi and Mr. puri.
52. D Statement 1 cannot be an assumption as the author in the paragraph states that ‘to realize a 7 percent GDP growth
rate in India, which is very much attainable….’
Statement 2 can be an assumption because the paragraph clearly states that GDP growth rate will increase when
capital formation in the country must increase to 30 percent of the GDP.
Statement 3 cannot be an assumption as nothing like this is mentioned in the paragraph.
Hence no option out of A, B and C is correct.
53. A The question deals with city council coming up with $1 water bottle, whereas private players are selling it for $1.5.
Statement 1 cannot be the course of action as maybe there is a scope for both private and government players to
survive in the market.
Statement 2 cannot be the answer as the City council is not obligated to provide for the losses of any private player.
Statement 3 cannot be the answer because normal tap water supply can still be used by the people.

There is no as such logic followed in this arrangement, Instead it is a random arrangement and the advantage of
such arrangement is that we don’t need to solve the whole arrangement logically and we can just compare and
mark the answers.

STEP 1- the Be You Change To Wish In See World This
STEP 2- You Be The Change To World In See Wish This
STEP 3- You See The This To World In Be Wish Change
STEP 4 see You This The World To Be In Change wish
54. C We are given the input as
‘ Don’t cry because it’s over smile since it’s actually happened’.
And we are asked for the step 4 of this input, Now instead of solving we can simply compare that first word of step
4 is 7th word of input and the last word is 5th word of the input .
Based upon this we can judge that first word is SINCE and last word will be over
So option 1st and 4th options are eliminated
Now the second word of step 4 is 4th word of the input. Therefore from the given input second word of step 4
should be it’s and from here we can conclude that (C) is the correct choice.
Since it’s actually cry happened smile don’t it because over
55. A We are given the 4th step as
‘dog sea school star ice moon flower home rock ball’
And we are asked for the input of this, Now instead of solving we can simply compare that first word of step 4 is
7th word of input and the last word is 5th word of the input .
Based upon this we can judge that seventh word of input should be dog , Only option A has seventh word as dog
and hence is the required input . Further to ensure the last word should be ice and is also true for option A

58. A Places Distance Travel Mode Speed Time
Mumbai – Kanyakumari 950 Bus 40 950/40 = 23.75 hrs
Bhubaneswar – Chennai 950 Ship 30 950/30 = 730 hrs
Chennai – Kochi 901 Ship 30 901/30 ? 30 hrs
Mumbai – Chennai 1000 Ship 30 1000/30 > 30 hrs 59. B Option A: Mumbai – Bhubaneswar (Bus) = 701? 2
Bhubaneswar - Kochi (Airplane) = 798 ? 5
Total = 1402 + 3990 = 5392
Option B: Mumbai - Chennai (Ship) = 1000 ? 1.5
Chennai - Kochi (ship) = 901? 1.5
Total = 1500+1351.5 = 2857.5
Option C: Mumbai - Kanyakumari (Bus) = 950 ? 2
Kanyakumari - Kochi (Train) = 1100 ? 2.5
Total = 1900 + 2750 = 4650
Option D: Mumbai - Vizag (Airplane) = 500 ? 5
Vizag – Kochi (Airplane) = 600 ? 5
Total = 5500
Therefore, least cost route to reach Kochi is Mumbai – Chennai – Kochi, option B.
60. A Six different cases are possible. (Train = 2.5 Rs/km, Ship = 1.5 Rs/km.)

Bhubaneswar 950 Chennai = 4300
Thus, the minimum cost for entire trip per student comes out to be Rs. 4300
61. C Using options, we have
Bhubaneswar - Chennai (Ship) = 950km / 30kmph = 31.67 hrs
Bhubaneswar – Kanyakumari (Train) = 700km / 25kmph = 28 hrs
Bhubaneswar – Mumbai (Bus) = 701km / 40kmph = 17.525 hrs
Bhubaneswar -Vizag (Train) = 1002/km / 25kmph = 40.08 hrs
Thus, least time would be taken to reach Mumbai.
62. B Using options, we get
Kochi - Vizag = 600?5 = 3000 Rs.
Kochi - Chennai = 901?1.5 + Chennai - Vizag = 300?2.5 = 2051.S
Kochi - Kanyakumari = 1100?2.5 + Kanyakumari -Vizag = 250?1.5 = 3125
Kochi - Mumbai = 300?2.5 = + Mumbai - Vizag = 500?5 = 3250
Thus, the least cost way to reach VIZAG will be option B.
63. B Total number of mergers for the entire period = 1499
And, total number of mergers and acquisitions = 5646
Thus, number of acquisitions = 5646 – 1499 = 4147
Percentage of mergers to acquisitions = (1499/4147)x100 = 36.15%.
Hence, option B.
64. D The following table can be formed from the given information:

As we can see from the above table, 5 sectors have greater than 20% proportion of mergers to mergers &
acquisitions.
65. D It can be observed that 5 sectors namely (1) Food & Beverage, (2) IT & Telecom, (3) Diversified, (4) Financial
Services and (5) Other Services have more (> ½) merger activity in the first 3 years as compared to the last 3 years.
66. D Turbulence = Sum of differences (in absolute terms)in number of mergers & acquisitions on a year-on-year basis.

Higher number of acquisitions - 6 5 7 3
As we can see from the above table, maximum 7 sectors in the year 2005-06 have higher number of acquisitions
compared to the previous year.

Total consumption in 2010 is coal =540×1.15=621 MTOE
Crude Oil=290×1.1=319 MTOE
Natural gas=80×1.05=84 MTOE
Hydro Electricity=50×1.1=55 MTOE

403.53 + 97 + 785.5 + 30.36 + 63.52 + 29.1 = 1409
Thus, proportion of coal in 2012 = (785.5/1409)x100 = 56%
72. B Year Nuclear energy Hydro-electricity
2009 20 50
2010 24 55
2011 27.6 57.75
Thus, domestic production of nuclear energy in 2011 = 27.6 x 1 = 27.6 MTOE & domestic production of hydroelectricity
in 2011 = 57.75 x 0.95 = 54.9 MTOE
Thus, approximate sum of nuclear energy & hydro-electricity (domestic production) in 2011 = 27.6 + 54.9 = 82.5
MTOE. Hence, the correct answer is option B.

Ellen Inc. is a Mumbai based company which sells five products branded as A, B, C, D and E in India. Anita
looks after entire sales of North India working from regional office in Delhi. She was preparing for annual
review meeting scheduled next day in Mumbai. She was attempting to analyse sales in North India for the
seven year period from 2009 to 2015. She first calculated average sales in rupees of all the five brands and
constructed a table exhibiting the difference between average sales of each pair of brands as shown in the
following table:

SECTION – 3 (Part- I)
DIRECTIONS for question 61 to 76: Read the following passages carefully and answer the questions given
at the end of each passage.
Passage 1
Because of the critical role played by steel in economic development, the steel industry is often considered,
especially by the governments, which traditionally owned it, to be an indicator of economic prowess. World
production has grown exponentially, but there were big highs and equally big lows all through the 1900s and
up to 2002. Recovery from the two World Wars and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused massive
disruption and lay-offs. Over-capacity and low steel prices continued to play havoc through the 1970s and
1980s and politicians began to lose their belief that the wealth of a nation was directly coupled to its steel
production.
This led to a wave of privatisations, as state-owned enterprises shed their financial liabilities to hungry
capitalists. A whole new breed of steel-makers came into being using a new technology, the mini-mill. This
used a smaller electric-arc furnace fed that just melts down 'cold' scrap. It was a cheaper process than the
traditional 'hot metal integrated mills' with their mountains of ore and coal and monumental machinery, but it
was used almost exclusively for lower-grade building and other '.long' products.
By the beginning of 2005, the world steel industry was on a high, after decades of moving from apocalypse to
break-even and then back to apocalypse. Since 2003, when a staggering 960 million tonnes were produced -
compared to 21.9 million tonnes for aluminium - there had been unprecedented demand, mainly from China
and India. China was both the biggest producer, the first country to exceed 200 million tonnes of crude steel in
a year, and also its biggest consumer at 244 million tonnes. The global economy was also booming, but this
was creating production bottlenecks for all steel-makers and by 2004 steel had for the first time hit an average
of $650 per tonne shipped. Profit margins were better, but where was the growth to come from? In tandem,
the costs of essential raw materials for steel-making - iron ore and coking coal - had gone through the roof,
along with bulk shipping costs. The key to future growth was to secure plants in emerging markets where ore
and coal were close to production sites, labour costs were much lower and where technology and investment
could spur greater savings.
But the central issue was that globally the industry remained a very fragmented one. No single company was
producing 100 million tonnes a year, or 10 per cent of total world production. The name of the game was
consolidation into fewer, bigger players. With this would come the chance for steel-makers to gain greater
pricing power, increasing their profitability and the value of their shares.
Two groups had begun to move ahead of the pack. One was Mittal Steel with its operational headquarters in
London's prestigious Berkeley Square. Mittal Steel was the world's biggest producer of 'long' products. It was
young, aggressive, fast, and a big risk-taker, fuelled by its founder Lakshmi Mittal's visionary zeal to
consolidate the industry. It's nearest rival, Arcelor - the world's most profitable steel company, focusing on
'flat' products - was headed by the Frenchman Guy Dolle, and was a combination of three former state-owned
European steel plants: Arbed of Luxembourg, Usinor from France and Spain's Aceralia. These three were now
merged, restructured and administered from the grandiose, chateau-like former Arbed headquarters in
Luxembourg's Avenue de la L;berte.
Both grouis were passionate about steel. Mittal, already dubbed 'the Carnegie from Calcutta', had a clearer
vision of the need to sireamline steel, but Arcelor was determined to become the biggest as well as the best
Dominating the market would enable either firm to increase its pricing position with customers, the carmakers,
ship-builders and construction firms, as well as chasing growth in the new markets of Asia, South
America and Eastern Europe.

Guy Dolle could hear the clump of Mittal's feet marching ahead, and it hurt. Arcelor was Europe's reigning
steel champion and was arrogantly proud of it. It had a commanding market share of the specialised highstrength
steel supplied to European car-makers and a total overall production approaching 50 million tonnes a
year, all with state-of-the-art technology. The group had repaired its consolidated balance sheet, ravished by
decades of downturns and continual restructuring costs. It had invested heavily in the quest for best
technology and had also acquired companies in Brazil, set up joint ventures in Russia, Japan and China and
now was eagerly eyeing gateways to the North American car market. And to its long-suffering shareholders,
starved of decent dividends. Arcelor was at last moving in the right direction, after the blood, sweat and tears
of shifting from public to private sector. The Luxembourg group was clearly on a wake-up call, gunning to
overtake Mittal Steel and keep it at bay.
By 2005, the battle for supremacy had begun to heat up. Two projected state sell-offs by public auction, in
Turkey and Ukraine, were particularly attractive commercially. Both auctions were taking place in October,
within three weeks of each other. The first, in Turkey, was for the 46.3 percent of government-owned shares
in Erdemir, a steel-maker producing 3.5 million tonnes a year for car-makers and other industrial clients in a
country of seventy million people shaping up to join the European Union. Mittal and Arcelor both already
owned minority stakes in the Turkish company and were eager to get majority control.
61. Which of the following statements is true?
1. In 2003, China consumed more steel than it produced
2. Mittal Steel was the world's most profitable steel company in mid 2000s
3. Arcelor was a bigger producer of steel than Mittal
4. All of the above
62. Which among the following is the common objective both Mittal and Arcelor had for aspiring to
become bigger steel-makers?
1. To consolidate the rather fragmented steel industry
2. To facilitate privatisation initiatives of the government
3. To have 10% of the industry share
4. To increase pricing position with customers
63. From the above passages, it clearly emerges that:
1. Arcleor had delivered good returns to its shareholders
2. Mittal Steel was Arcelor's nearest competitor
3. By 2005, steel industry was in recession
4. A nation's steel production continues to be a good indicator of its wealth
64. What are the plausible reasons for privatisation in steel industry?
1. Slow growth in world production
2. Lobbying by the capitalists
3. Havoc played by over-capacity and falling steel prices
4. Introduction of the 'mini-mill"
Passage 2
In the decades that Otlet's papers had sat gathering dust, his dream of a universal knowledge of network had
found a new expression across the Atlantic, where a group of engineers and computer scientists laid the
groundwork for what would eventually become the Internet. Beginning during the Cold War, the United
States poured money into a series of advanced research projects that would eventually lead to the creation of
www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c om
15 Bulls Eye IIFT Paper 2015
the technologies underpinning the present-day Internet. In the 1990s, the World Wide Web appeared and
quickly attracted a widespread audience, eventually establishing itself as the foundation of a global
knowledge-sharing network much like the one that Otlet envisioned.
Today, the emergence of that network has triggered a series of dramatic - perhaps even "axial" -
transformations. In 2011, the world's population generated more than 1.8 zettabytes of data, including
documents, images, phone calls, and radio and television signals. More than a billion people now use Web
browsers, and that number will almost certainly increase for years to come. In an era when almost anyone
with a mobile phone can press a few keys to search the contents of the world's libraries, when millions of
people negotiate their personal relationships via online social networks, and when institutions of all stripes
find their operations disrupted by the sometimes wrenching effects of networks, it scarcely seems like
hyperbole - and has even become cliche - to suggest that the advent of the Internet ranks as an event of
epochal significance.
While Otlet did not by any stretch of imagination "invent" the Internet - working as he did in an age before
digital computers, magnetic storage, or packet-switching networks -nonetheless his vision looks nothing short
of prophetic. In Otlet's day, microfilm may have qualified as the most advanced information storage
technology, and the closest thing anyone had ever seen to a database was a drawer full of index cards. Yet
despite these analog limitations, he envisioned a global network of interconnected institutions that would alter
the flow of information around the world, and in the process lead to profound social, cultural, and political
transformations.
By today's standards, Otlet's proto-Web was a clumsy affair, relying on a patchwork system of index cards,
file cabinets, telegraph machines, and a small army of clerical workers. But in his writing he looked far ahead
to a future in which networks circled the globe and data could travel freely. Moreover, he imagined a wide
range of expression taking shape across the network: distributed encyclopaedias, virtual classrooms, threedimensional
information spaces, social networks, and other forms of knowledge that anticipated the
hyperlinked structure of today's Web. He saw these developments as fundamentally connected to a larger
Utopian project that would bring the world closer to a state of permanent and lasting peace and toward a state
of collective spiritual enlightenment.
The conventional history of the Internet traces its roots through an Anglo-American lineage of early computer
scientists like Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and Alan Turing; networking visionaries like Vinton G. Cerf
and Robert E. Kahn; as well as hypertext seers like Vannevar Bush, J.C.R. Licklider, Douglas Engelbart, Ted
Nelson, and of course Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau, who in 1991 released their first version of the
World Wide Web. The dominant influence of the modern computer industry has placed computer science at
the centre of this story.
Nonetheless Otlet's work, grounded in an age before microchips and semiconductors, opened the door to an
alternative stream of thought, one undergirding our present-day information age even though it has little to do
with the history of digital computing. Well before the first Web servers started sending data packets across the
Internet, a number of other early twentieth-century figures were pondering the possibility of a new, networked
society: H.G. Wells, the English science fiction writer and social activist, who dreamed of building a World
Brain, Emanuel Goldberg, a Russian Jew who invented a fully functional mechanical search engine in 1930s
Germany before fleeing the Nazis; Scotland's Patrick Geddes and Austria's Otto Neurath, who both explored
new kinds of highly designed, propagandists museum exhibits designed to foster social change; Germany's
Wilhelm Ostwald, the Nobel Prize-winning chemist who aspired to build a vast new 'brain of humanity'; the
sculptor Hendrik Andersen and the architect Le Corbusier, both of whom dreamed of designing a World City
to house a new, one-world government with a networked information repository at its epicentre. Each shared a
commitment to social transformation through the use of available technologies. They also each shared a direct
connection to Paul Otlet, who seems to connect a series of major turning points in the history of the early
twentieth-century information age, synthesizing and incorporating their ideas along with his own, and
ultimately coming tantalizingly close to building a fully integrated global information network.

Passage 3
Every loan has a lender and a borrower; both voluntarily engage in the transaction. If the loan goes bad, there
is at least a prima facie case that the lender is as guilty as the borrower. In fact, since lenders are supposed to
be sophisticated in risk analysis and in making judgements about a reasonable debt burden, they should
perhaps bear even more culpability.
Does it make a difference if we say there is over-lending rather than over-borrowing? The difference in where
we see the problem affects where we seek the solution. Is the problem more on the side of the lenders, that
they are not exercising due diligence in judging who is creditworthy? Or on the borrowers, being profligate
and irresponsible? If we consider the problem to be over borrowing, then we naturally think of making it more
difficult for borrowers to discharge their debts; on the contrary, if the problem is over lending, we focus on
strengthening incentives for lenders to exercise due diligence.
The political economy of over-borrowing is easy to understand. The current borrowing government benefits
and later governments have to deal with the consequences. But why have sophisticated, profit maximizing
lenders so often over-lent? Lenders encourage indebtedness because it is profitable. Developing country
governments are sometimes even pressured to over-borrow. There may be kickbacks in loans, or even more
frequently in the projects that they finance. Even without corruption, it is easy to be influenced by Western
businessmen and financiers. They wine and dine those responsible for borrowing as they sell their loan
packages, and tell them why this is a good time to borrow, why their particular package is attractive, why this
is the right time to restructure debt? Countries that are not sure that borrowing is worth the risk are told how
important it is to establish a credit rating: borrow even if you really don't need the money.
Excessive borrowing increases the chance of a crisis, and the costs of a crisis are borne not just by lenders but
by all of society. In recent years, IMF programs may have resulted in significant further distortions in lenders'
incentives. When crisis occurred, the IMF lent money in what was called a 'bail-out'- but the money was not
really a bail-out for the country; it was a bail out for Western banks. In both East Asia and Latin America,
bail-outs provided money to repay foreign creditors, thus absolving creditors from having to bear the costs of
their mistaken lending. In some instances, governments even assumed private liabilities, effectively
www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c om
17 Bulls Eye IIFT Paper 2015
socializing private risk. The creditors were left off the hook, but the IMF's money wasn't a gift, just another
loan- and the developing country was left to pay the bill. In effect, the poor country's taxpayers paid for rich
country's lending mistakes.
The bail-outs give rise to the famous 'moral hazard' problem. Moral hazard arises when a party does not bear
all the risks associated with his action and as a result does not do everything he can to avoid risk. The term
originates in the insurance literature; it was deemed immoral for an individual to take less care in preventing a
fire simply because he had insurance coverage. It is, of course, simply a matter of incentives: those with
insurance may not set their houses on fire deliberately, but their incentive to avoid a fire is still weakened.
With loans, the risk is default, with all of its consequences; lenders can reduce that risk simply by lending less.
If they perceive a high likelihood of a bail-out, they lend more than they otherwise would.
Lending markets are also characterized by, in the famous words of former chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Alan Greenspan, 'irrational exuberance', as well as irrational pessimism. Lenders rush into a market in
a mood of optimism, and rush out when the mood changes. Markets move in fads and fashions, and it is hard
to resist joining the latest fad. If only one firm were affected by a mood of irrational optimism, it would have
to bear the cost of its mistake; but when large numbers share the same mood, in a fad, there are macroeconomic
consequences, potentially affecting everyone in the country.
69. The author is trying to find the underlying cause of:
1. Financial crisis in the economy
2. Under development in the developing world

Passage 4
The mass media have been recognized as politically significant since the advent of mass literacy and the
popular press in the late nineteenth century. However, it is widely accepted that, through a combination of
social and technological changes, the media have become increasingly more powerful political actors and, in
some respects, more deeply enmeshed in the political process. Three developments are particularly
IIFT Paper 2015
18
Bulls Eye
www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c om
noteworthy. First, the impact of the so-called 'primary' agents of political socialization, such as the family and
social class, has declined. Whereas once people acquired, in late childhood and adolescence in particular, a
framework of political sympathies and leanings that adult experience tended to modify or deepen, but seldom
radically transformed, this has been weakened in modern society by greater social and geographical mobility
and by the spread of individualist and consumerist values. Abiding political allegiances and habitual voting
patterns have thus given way to a more instrumental approach to politics, in which people make political
choices according to a calculation of personal self-interest based on the issues and policy positions on offer.
This, in turn, widens the scope for the media's political influence, as they are the principal mechanism through
which information about issues and policies, and therefore political choices, is presented to the public.
Second, the development of mass television audience from the 1950s onwards, and more recently the
proliferation of channels and media output associated with the 'new' media, has massively increased the mass
media's penetration into people's everyday lives. This means that the public now relies on the mass media
more heavily than ever before: for instance, television is a much more important source of news and current
affairs information than political meetings; many more people watch televised sport than participate in it; and
even shopping is increasingly being carried out through shopping channels and the internet.
Third, the media have become more powerful economic actors. Not only have major media corporations
become more powerful global players, but also a series of mergers has tended to incorporate the formerly
discrete domains of publishing, television, film, music, computers and telecommunications into a single
massive 'infotainment' industry. Media businesses such as Microsoft, AOL-Time Warner, Disney and Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation have accumulated so much economic and market power that no government can
afford to ignore them.
Few commentators doubt the media's ability to shape political attitudes and values or, at least, to structure
political and electoral choice by influencing public perceptions about the nature and importance of issues and
problems, thereby. However, there is considerable debate about the political significance of this influence. A
series of rival theories offer contrasting views of the media's political impact.
The pluralist model of the mass media portrays the media as an ideological marketplace in which wide range
of political views are debated and discussed. While not rejecting the idea that the media can affect political
views and sympathies, this nevertheless suggests that their impact is essentially neutral in that they reflect the
balance of forces within the society at large. The pluralist view nevertheless portrays the media in strongly
positive terms. In ensuring the 'informed citizenry', the mass media both enhance the quality of democracy and
guarantee that government power is checked. This 'watchdog' role was classically demonstrated in the 1974
Washington Post investigation into the Watergate scandal, which led to the resignation of Richard Nixon as
US President. Some, moreover, argue that the advent of the 'new' media, and particularly the Internet, has
strengthened pluralism and political competition by giving protest groups a relatively cheap and highly
effective means of disseminating information and organizing campaigns.
The dominant ideology model portrays media as a politically conservative force that is aligned to the interests
of economic and social elites, and serves to promote compliance or passivity amongst the masses. The
ownership ultimately determines the political and other views that the mass media disseminate, and
ownerships are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small number of global media corporations.
The elite-values model shifts attention away from the ownership of media corporations to the mechanism
through which media output is controlled. This view suggests that editors, journalists and broadcasters enjoy
significant professional independence, and that even the most interventionist of media moguls is able only to
set a broad political agenda but not the day-to-day editorial decision-making. The media's political bias
therefore reflects the values of groups that are disproportionally represented amongst its senior professionals.
The market model of the mass media differs from the other models in that it dispenses with the idea of media
bias: it holds that newspaper and television reflect, rather than shape, the views of general public. This occurs
because, regardless of the personal views of media owners and senior professionals, private media outlets are
first and foremost businesses concerned with profit maximization and thus with extending market share. The
www. h i t b u l l s e y e . c om
19 Bulls Eye IIFT Paper 2015
media therefore give people 'what they want', and cannot afford to alienate existing or potential viewers and
readers by presenting political viewpoints with which they may disagree.

Using Pythagoras theorem, we get x = 4.1m
So x - 1.2 = 2.9m ? (7.6)2 = (2.9)2 + (y + 6.4)2 ? y = 0.6m.
20. 4 The given equation is 4x - 9 + 4x + 9 = 5 + 7 .
Just put x = 4 in the above equation, we get 4 × 4 - 9 + 4 × 4 + 9 = 5 + 7
= 5 + 7 = 5 + 7 which is true.

22. 1 The probability of failing in first trimester is 0.08. So the probability of passing the first trimester = 0.92. The
combined probability of passing second and third trimester is 0.87. Hence the probability that the student will
complete the first year = 0.92 × 0.87 = 0.8.

are 2 ways i.e. to select or not selecting it.
35. 2 We can select a maximum of all 3 countries if condition 1 is met with. As per the condition USA & UAE both
have to be selected. So we can only select USA & UAE or select all 3. So best option is B. (Max 2 countries)
36. 2 Either 2 or 1 countries can be selected if only conditions 2 & 3 are complied with Those could be one among
USA or UK or If UK is selected then UAE is also selected.

37. 3 Checking through the choices for the relationship between W and X as niece and uncle we find choice C to be
correct. Checking C.
Since, W is daughter of Y and X is brother of Y, so, W is niece of X.
38. 3 Making the diagram as per given instructions
Now, from the diagram it is clear that the distance between starting point A and end point B is 5 miles using
Pythagoras theorem.
39. 4
So, no conclusion precisely follows. Hence, none of these.
40- As per the given conditions we can draw a flow chart.
40. 3 Now we can say that only 2 cities U & V are crossed to reach T from S.
41. 2 Longest route from P to U is P -Q - R - T -V - U. So, 4 cities are crossed in the route except P & U.
42. 3 Checking the options with the diagram we can observe that connecting U to Q with 2 way connection
minimizes the transit cities. Hence option C.

44. 1 Absolute difference between average annual sales in highest for 1 ton Ac and ½ ton AC.
45. 3 1.5 ton AC has performed the second best in half yearly sales performance.
46. 4 In February 2015, total WAC monthly sales performance was the highest.
47. 4 2 ton AC has least Sales volatility.
48. 3 The total sales of product B = 5800
The average sales of product B = 828.57
7
5800 =
The difference between average of A and B is 214.29
? Average of A = 214.29 + 828.57 = 1042.86
Hence the total of A = 1042.86 × 7 = 7300
Let the value of A in 2013 = x crore
The total of A from table = 6800 + x
? 6800 + x = 7300 ? x = 500
? sales of A in 2013 = Rs. 500 crore
The difference between the average of B and C = - 342.86 crore
? Average of C = 828.57+342.86 = 1171.43 crores
Hence total of C = 1171.43 × 7 = Rs. 8200 crore
Let the sales of C in 2010 = Rs. y crore
The total of C from table = 7400 + y
? 7400 + y = 8200 ? y = 800
? Sales of C in 2010 = Rs. 800 crore
The difference between the average of B and D = - 71.43 crore
? Average of D = 828.57 + 71.43 = 900 crore
Hence total of D = 900 × 7 = Rs. 6300 crore
Let the sales of D in 2012 = Rs. Z crore
The total sales of D from table = 5700 + Z
? 5700 + Z = 6300
? Z = Rs 600 crore.
49. 2 The total sales of all products in 2010 = Rs. 4700 crore
The total sales of all products in 2011 = Rs. 4200 crore.
The total sales of all products in 2012 = Rs. 4500 crore.
The total sales of all products in 2013 = Rs. 4400 crore.
Since the sales in 2011 is minimum, so average is also minimum in 2011.
50. 2 The total sales of products A, B, D and E are Rs. 7300 crore, Rs. 5800 crore, Rs. 6300 crore & Rs. 7000 crore
respectively. Since the sales of product B are minimum, hence its average will also be minimum.
51. 4 The difference between the average sales of product D and product E is Rs. 100 crore, which is least.

61. 1 An overall reading of the passage suggests this.
62. 4 Para 6, 3rd Line (Dominating the market…Either firm to increase its pricing position with customers)
63. 2 Para 5, Line 5, (Its nearest rival, Arcelor..) Option A (The passage does not talk about Arcelor & its
shareholders; Option C is false as the Steel industry had recovered from the crises by 2005; Option D this line
is nowhere mentioned in the passage
64. 3 Option C is directly stated in 1st Para, Last Line & 2nd Para 1st Line
65. 2 2nd Para, Last Line (In an era….to suggest that the advent of the internet ranks...)
66. 3 Option A ruled out..look at 3rd Para, 1st Line (While Outlet did not…)In the very same line, it is mentioned that
his vision looks nothing short of Prophetic; hence Option C is the correct choice
67. 2 Option B is clearly mentioned in Para 6,3rd Line (Each shared a commitment to social transformation...)

33 Bulls Eye IIFT Paper 2015
68. 4 Para 4 talks about Outlet’s idea being Futuristic, Visionary and Utopian. Hence, Option D is the correct choice
69. 1 In most of the passage the author is talking about the mentioned issue.
70. 1 Refer para 5 , line 2 “mortal hazards arises …. He had insurance coverage.”
71. 3 Refer para 4 , line 2 “ in the recent years… socializing private risk.”
72. 3 Refer para 4 , 4th line from the bottom “ in effect … mistakes.”
73. 1 From the overall reading of the passage only option 1 can be implied.
74. 3 Refer the first paragraph “first, the impact….has declined..
75. 4 From the overall reading of the passage , the answer can be easily deduced.
76. 3 Refer para 5, line 6 – “the pluralist view … terms.”
77. 3 The opening line of the passage has already been given. this will be followed by statement p “one argument ….
Universe.” Statement S forms a mandatory pair with statement P “another argument …. God.” This is to be
followed by Q- “he …. Technique Thus the sequence is RPSQ.
78. 1 S1 has been mentioned as the opening sentence. Statement S follows the opening sentence most logically, One
day……. Bazaar. It is to be followed by statement P “on the way……… watered. Since P and R form a pair,
the next statement R “but……. Still will follow. Thus the sequence should be SPRQ
79. 4 It means to emphasize
80. 1 It means to have an end to serve
81. 4 To get carried away is defined as to become overly excited or involved and to take things too far, Carry on
means to continue despite difficulties; Carry out means to bring to a successful issue or complete
82. 1 Hang Over means a severe headache or other after-effects caused by drinking an excess of alcohol. Hang up
one’s boots means to give up a sport permanently; Hang around means to roam around freely; Hanging on to
each word means everything you say is being thought over and absorbed by the person reading or listening
83. 2 In the second blank, the use of “from” suggests that the terrain is different from that of Europe.
84. 3 the 1st part of the sentence refers to the processes that go beyond our reason, hence the most appropriate choice
is “defied”
85. 3 Milieu means a person's social environment
86. 1 Gaffe means an unintentional act or remark causing embarrassment to its originator; a blunder
87. 4 Emancipated means to free from restraint, control, or the power of another; especially : to free from bondage;

food.
88. 3 We always use” from” with remove
89. 2 Qualm means a feeling of uneasiness about a point especially of conscience or propriety
90. 3 Because of the Preposition “TO” we can only use the word Alternative in the 1st blank. And in the second
Blank we are talking about the risk of lung & mouth cancers, Hence, Option C is the correct answer
91. 2 Conspiracy has to be planned secretly,” Clandestine” means secretly
92. 2 You can’t be natural if you are acting.
93. 4 All of these are applicable
94. 2 Since, the word ‘Although’ has been used; the next segment should about something similar but of a lesser
degree. Hence, Option B is the correct choice
95. 4 Cacophony means a harsh discordant mixture of sounds & Euphony means the quality of being pleasing to
the ear. Both are sound patterns used in verse to achieve opposite effects: euphony is pleasing and harmonious.
