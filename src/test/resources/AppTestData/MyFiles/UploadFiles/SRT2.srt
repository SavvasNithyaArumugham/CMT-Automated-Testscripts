100:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000Hi my name is Roseanne Hoffman.200:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000In this video we will be learning the concept of Variation and Prediction Intervals.300:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000For a single point XY, we have the predicted value Y hat from the regression equation and the mean of the sample values of Y is Y bar.400:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000For a single point XY, we have the predicted value Y hat from the regression equation and the mean of the sample values of Y is Y bar.500:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000This is called total deviation, Y minus Y bar.600:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000It is the vertical distance, from a particular point, to the horizontal line, passing through the sample mean Y bar.700:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000The explained deviation, Y hat minus Y bar, is the vertical distance between the predicted value of Y800:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000and the horizontal line passing through the sample mean Y bar.900:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000The unexplained deviation, Y minus Y hat, is the vertical distance between the actual data value of Y and the predicted value of Y, namely Y hat,1000:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000The unexplained deviation, Y minus Y hat, is the vertical distance between the actual data value of Y and the predicted value of Y, namely Y hat,1100:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000at that X value from the regression equation.1200:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000For a particular point, XY, the total variation can be decomposed into two parts,1300:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000namely the explained variation and the unexplained variation.1400:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000Total variation can be viewed as the sum of the explained and the unexplained variation.1500:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000The same relationship applies to the sum of the squares.1600:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000Let's look at these two equations.1700:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000If I hide Y hat and the negative Y hat, you can see that you have Y, minus Y bar, which is exactly what is on the left hand side.1800:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000If I hide Y hat and the negative Y hat, you can see that you have Y, minus Y bar, which is exactly what is on the left hand side.1900:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000So, we have basically taken this component and broken it into two pieces.2000:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000We can now square each of these pieces and then sum them.2100:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,000So we have the summation of Y minus Y bar, the quantity squared and then take the sum of it and on the other side we know2200:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000that this left side is equal to Y hat minus Y bar, the quantity squared, the summation of that, plus Y minus Y hat,2300:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000that this left side is equal to Y hat minus Y bar, the quantity squared, the summation of that, plus Y minus Y hat,2400:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000the quantity squared, and the summation of that quantity.2500:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000R squared is the explained variation divided by the total variation.2600:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000The co-efficient of determination is the amount of variation in Y that is explained by the regression line.2700:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000For example, in an earlier section we noted that if R is equal is .922, then R squared is equal to.85.2800:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000For example, in an earlier section we noted that if R is equal is .922, then R squared is equal to.85.2900:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000What does this mean?3000:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,000It says that eighty five percent of the total variation in Y can be explained by the linear relationship between X and Y. Well,3100:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000then from that you can figure that fifteen percent is the unexplained.3200:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000then from that you can figure that fifteen percent is the unexplained.3300:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000Let us look at the standard error of the estimate.3400:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000Here is the formula, but before we go through the formula, let us discuss the development of predictive intervals requires a measure3500:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000of the spread of sample points about the regression line.3600:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000The standard error of the estimate is a collective measure of the spread of the sample points about the regression line.3700:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000Now let us look a little more closely at the formula.3800:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000S of E is equal to the square root of the quantity, which is really a ratio of Y minus Y hat,3900:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000the quantity squared sum, divided by sample size minus two.4000:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000Another formula that can also be used to come up with the same answer, is the square root of Y square, the sum of that,4100:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000minus B sub-zero times the summation of Y, minus B sub-one, times the summation of XY.4200:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000That whole numerator divided by N minus two.4300:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000We now develop a means to obtain a prediction interval, which will give a confidence interval estimate of the predicted Y value.4400:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000We can use the standard error of estimate to construct interval estimates, that is confidence intervals,4500:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000that will help us see how dependable our point estimates of Y really are.4600:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000Given the six value, X sub-zero, the prediction interval for an individual Y value is, Y hat minus the margin of error,4700:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000Given the six value, X sub-zero, the prediction interval for an individual Y value is, Y hat minus the margin of error,4800:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000is less than Y hat plus the margin of error, recalling that E represents the margin of error.4900:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000Now how do you calculate the margin of error?5000:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000E is equal to T alpha divided by two, times the S of E and then the square root of one plus one5100:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000over N plus N times the quantity X sub-zero minus X bar, that quantity squared, in the numerator, divided by N times the quantity5200:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000over N plus N times the quantity X sub-zero minus X bar, that quantity squared, in the numerator, divided by N times the quantity5300:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000of the X's which have already been squared and then summed minus the sum of the X's and then squared.5400:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000Remember, that X sub-zero represents the given value of XT alpha divided by two has N minus two degrees of freedom5500:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000Remember, that X sub-zero represents the given value of XT alpha divided by two has N minus two degrees of freedom5600:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000and S of E is the standard error of the estimate.5700:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000and S of E is the standard error of the estimate.5800:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000Let us look at an example about boats and manatees deaths.5900:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000Here is the set of data, indicating the years and the number of boats and the number of deaths.6000:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000Here is the set of data, indicating the years and the number of boats and the number of deaths.6100:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000Using the data, we find the regression equation Y hat is equal to a negative 114.84 plus 2.30 X. We want to know for a particular X value,6200:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000Using the data, we find the regression equation Y hat is equal to a negative 114.84 plus 2.30 X. We want to know for a particular X value,6300:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000namely 85, what is the predicted Y hat.6400:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000Y hat is going to be equal to negative 114.84 plus 2.30.6500:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000Where the X is, we are going to replace it with 85.6600:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000If we calculate this quantity, we will find out that it's 80.6.6700:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000Let us now find out a ninety five percent predication interval for the number of manatee deaths6800:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000when the number of boats is eighty five.6900:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000Recall the standard of error of estimate is this terrible looking equation.7000:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000What we are going to do is substitute for the summation of Y squared, the summation of Y times B sub-zero,7100:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000the summation of XY times negative B sub-one and we are going to divide it by M minus two.7200:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000We had a sample of ten, so N minus two would turn out to be eight.7300:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000If you crank this out on the calculator, you will find out that the standard error is 6.61.7400:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000From Table A-3, with eight degrees of freedom and an alpha .05, we will find out that the T7500:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000of alpha divided by two is equal to 2.306.7600:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000We need this value to substitute for T alpha divided by two.7700:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000We have the standard error, we put in here and again the numbers N was ten, so it's one divided by ten,7800:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000sample size ten times X sub-zero which is eight five minus X bar, 74.1, that quantity squared, divided by sample size summation7900:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000sample size ten times X sub-zero which is eight five minus X bar, 74.1, that quantity squared, divided by sample size summation8000:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000sample size ten times X sub-zero which is eight five minus X bar, 74.1, that quantity squared, divided by sample size summation8100:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000of the X's squared, minus the sum of X, that quantity squared.8200:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000This whole mess gives us an error of 18.1.8300:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000Using 18.1, we are going to subtract that from Y hat and on the upper end we are going to add it to Y hat.8400:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000So our interval is now 62.5 to 98.7.8500:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000What does this say?8600:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,000Well, for X equal to 85, we have ninety five percent confidence that the number of manatee deaths is between 62.5 and 98.7.8700:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000Well, for X equal to 85, we have ninety five percent confidence that the number of manatee deaths is between 62.5 and 98.7.8800:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000This prediction interval is relatively large.8900:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000One factor, contributing to the large range, is that the sample size is small.9000:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000The concepts that we discussed here are very useful in real life applications.9100:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000Why don't you try some of the exercise on your own.9200:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000See you next time.
